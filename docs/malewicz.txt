Hey, Michal here.
And it's time for more.
Yeah, you know what it's time for?
It's time to release my
second UI design course.
This time it's for high fidelity
in mobile apps,
all four hours, completely free.
And in Figma.
Before we get to the course,
I need to just give you a little bit
of backstory around all this.
This is another course that
made nearly $80,000 in sales
and was super popular.
A lot of people said that it was
combined with the first mobile apps
course, a transformational
thing or a transformational step
on their path to designing better.
And in many cases they just got
their first job because of it.
The case studies that people did with
those courses were a big step towards
that because both those courses are
to be taken one after the other.
Of course, you can just start with
this one if you want, but it's best
to take them both and don't just
copy and repeat the stuff I do.
Make your own app.
I, I tell you how to do it
in this course as well.
It's about following the
principles, but making something
completely of your own because
then you have an awesome case
study project and that is
something really valuable if
you're looking for work or
clients.
If you want more of my courses
to go free, I have over 24 hours
of materials that I want to make free.
But you need to push this
video to more people.
So comment, like subscribe
and share it in as many places as you
can so we get those numbers up.
And once we get them up, I'm
going to post another four
hour course completely free
to this YouTube channel.
And if you want to grow even
further, there are a couple courses
that are not going to be free.
My web design courses, the Boring
UI course, the auto layout
course, and obviously
the Square block blueprint, which
is my best work to date.
And it's aimed at more medium and pro
users who want to be successful
freelancers or agency owners.
It includes everything I do, all
the templates, files, documents,
legal information, patterns, methods,
basically everything.
And many people are already
using it and their clients
are not believing their eyes.
They're like, what changed?
How have you become so good so quickly?
Well, this is how you can
get the blueprint in the link,
in the description.
But for now just enjoy this course
because I'm happy to help
more designers and developers
get better at what they do.
Because if you're a developer,
this is also going to be very useful
to you because it will allow you
to build your own stuff
looking better and working better.
Enjoy.
Hi welcome to the second part
of my UI design course.
This part of the course is
all about high fidelity.
And by high fidelity I mean
the consumer facing, finalized,
complete, beautiful user interface.
And in my professional career I
have always aimed at a, higher than
usual fidelity of my designs.
And this is still the driving
force between my company's
design team to this day.
We simply want to make the most
beautiful digital products imaginable.
Why?
Well, that's easy.
Customers buy with their eyes
first and then their wallets.
The first encounter they will
have with your product might not
be them actually using it yet it
may be an app store, product
page, a landing page, or seeing
someone else use it in a YouTube
video.
Whatever it is, the first thing they
notice is how the product looks like.
Then they evaluate what they see
against all the other great
products that they've used so far.
If it's at least on that level
of visual quality, then you've picked
their interest to find out more
about what the product actually does.
Sure there are the cases when people
are looking for a solution to a
specific problem that they have, but
chances are that there is more than
just your product that can solve that
problem.
Assuming the same price, guess
which one they will choose exactly?
The best looking one.
This is how our psychology works
and it's also based a little bit
on something called
the aesthetic usability effect.
This basically means that if a product
is aesthetically pleasing, people
automatically assume that it's better.
Here is an overview of some
of identifying traits
of a successful product.
The first one always is the value.
If the product has a great value
solves a great problem for a lot
of people, they will jump through
flaming hoops of bad UX
to use it and they will be happy.
Then the next one is a combination
of ease of use and deluxe.
Some place ease of use ahead,
but I'd say that it's about 50 50,
partially because
of the previously mentioned effect.
But in reality ease of use helps you
maintain the user once they start
using the product, while aesthetics
does that too, but also helps to get
the user to even download it or
install it.
As designers, our job is rarely
to define the value or product
market fit for what we build.
That's usually done by marketing
research or product teams.
Our job however is to make something
that works and looks great
if it just works but looks bad.
See what happens when
a similar but better looking
product comes along.
In this part of the course, we'll
take apart some of the techniques
that define the better
looking consumer facing products.
These will help you design
better visuals for the majority
of the projects that you're
going to be working with.
Keep in mind, however, that if you're
working on a very serious financial or
banking or professional service or
product, some of these techniques
might have to be dialed back a little
bit because these products have their
own rules.
I will share with you all of our
tips for designing the little
components like checkboxes, radio
buttons, buttons, text fields, all
the way to the decorative elements
and ways to actually make your
design stand out.
We'll go through the typical process
that we use at Hype for as well, when
the plan for the outline of the actual
design is already established.
So basically how to make
your design more beautiful.
For all the practical exercises, I will
be using the screens that I already
made in the first part of this course
with the Organic Shops app.
If you haven't taken the first part
of the course, don't worry.
These are all very simple screens
and in most cases I will try
to completely recreate them from
scratch using these new techniques.
All of my source files with
the starting points for this
exercise are going to be available
for you to download as well.
These techniques will be a great way
to improve your portfolio
projects, but they can also
be used in real projects
and collaborating with developers.
In some cases it will require your
developers to have a pretty open mind
toward design innovation like
the developers that we work with have.
But in a case like this, we
will also provide you with
an alternative solution.
So if you're working with a developer
that's a little bit more strict
and a lot more confined to the norm,
they'll also be able to code it well.
Ready?
Let's begin.
There is an ongoing misconception that
most of the high fidelity, beautiful
interface designs can't be accessible.
The use of shadows, subtle
gradients, and often lower contrast
items sparks controversy
among accessibility advocates.
In this segment we'll mostly talk
about the contrast issues.
Of course, lower contrast is a bad
idea because it excludes a large group
of people from enjoying the app.
Many of these controversies come
from the age old dribble
versus the UX world debate.
And some of the trends that
I helped create like
Neuomorphism or Glassmorphism.
Push the discussion even further.
I mean, how can a design like
this be accessible, right?
Well, it's not.
And even as I don't think
Neomorphism makes much sense
for most products, I don't believe
that it cannot be accessible.
There is just one rule you need
to follow and be aware of.
The rule is make the most important
UI elements always accessible
with high Enough contrast.
That means your form fields,
text buttons and switches all need
to pass the contrast checker
and have the proper size.
What you can play with and experiment
with is decoration.
These elements don't have to be
accessible as long as they're not
in the way, obstructing the view.
For people with vision problems, a good
example of this is the Humble card.
We are used to seeing a card like
this in many designs out there,
often accompanied paint
by another card below or next to it.
Is this card accessible?
Some will say no, because the shadow
under it is barely visible
on that white background, thus
rendering the card inaccessible.
While I can understand where
that logic comes from, this
is actually not quite true.
As long as the card contents follow
a good structure with proper
layout and hierarchy, the card
outline here is just decoration.
If you nail the margins and spacing
right, it's absolutely unimportant
whether the shadow is visible or not.
For those who can see it, it can add
a nice visual flair to the product.
Those who don't will still be able
to see the cards for what they are
and easily interact with them.
So to rephrase the rule, you
can use lower contrast in areas where
when you turn that object
entirely off, the product
won't lose any functionality or
usability or readability.
Cards, subtle background decorations or
shapes all fall within that category.
We will not explore special versions
of High Contrast for increased
readability in this course, but
they are also an option that will
allow even more customization and
tailoring to each person's
individual needs.
In this course, we'll create
a beautiful and accessible
interface using the AA guidelines.
If you want to explore accessibility
more from all points
of view, not only mine, I will add
a couple of extra reading materials
to the course outline.
PDF Ready?
Let's begin.
We finally know how to use the grid
to create nice layouts.
So now let's talk about some effects.
So I'm just gonna create a frame
in Figma and the frame
size doesn't really matter.
It's not supposed to be a phone yet,
it's just supposed to be a frame.
And I'm gonna name it Playground one.
Now let's select the frame
and let's click on the fill
to change the background.
And let's go with a, pretty
difficult color to use.
So I'm going to change the color
to yellow, but no saturated colors
or over the top dark ones.
So let's just pick something
from the top left quadrant
of the color palette.
So from the yellow palette, I'm just
going to pick A very pale yellow.
Now let's create a rectangle
in the middle just to check.
And I'm going to modify
the color of it to white.
So we want this effect of like
a barely visible white rectangle
on that yellow background.
Okay.
For now, let's just
remove the rectangle.
And using the text tool, I'm just
gonna write some text and I'm just
gonna go with doing shadows.
Right, because this part is
gonna be all about the shadows.
I'm using the very nice free font
plus Jakarta Sans, and I'm gonna
change the size of it to 44,
and then I'm gonna pick the color
of it to be the background color.
Then in here I'm gonna switch to HSB
and then just decrease the brightness,
which is the third value,
and I'm gonna decrease it down to 8.
You can try 18 as well, or you can
try 20, but try not to go over 20.
I'm gonna go with 8.
Now let's just change this font style
to extra bold, and I'm gonna
move it a little bit higher.
While playing with shadows,
the font is simply gonna add
a little bit extra context.
But of course, we need
to, align it first.
And don't worry about the notch
and about the status bars here.
Let's just create as 32
by 32, just as we did before.
And of course change the color to red.
And now just place one
on the left edge of the screen, one
on the top edge, and align that
font to optically match them.
Now let's remove one of the squares,
move the other one outside
of the frame, and let's create
our first card because we're going
to play with those shadows.
On a typical card, the height
of the card doesn't really matter.
And let's make it also 32 points
from the left and from the right edge.
So just use that square
to align this card perfectly
to fit within those boundaries.
So as you can see, I just need
to decrease the width a little bit.
Okay, now with even spacing on both
sides, let's put that square back
and let's play around with the card.
So first thing that I'm gonna do is
to change the color to white.
And as you can see, the card is barely
visible, but that's okay for now.
So let's select it and let's go
to the corner radius,
and I'm gonna Change it to 16.
You can go with a lower value,
but usually it's best when
you're just starting out your high
fidelity designs to not exceed 32,
because too much roundness
is actually gonna be bad.
Okay, having the card selected, let's
go to the right side and in effect
just click on the plus sign.
And as you can see, it adds
a drop shadow automatically.
But this drop shadow looks
a little bit boring and we don't
really want the generic look.
So click on the sun icon
and let's modify some values.
Let's start with the color.
So use the color picker
to pick the color from the backgr
and then go into brightness
again and decrease it by 10.
So you can just use 88 or 78 in my
case, you can use shift and down
and up arrow to modify these values.
Okay, once we have the color set,
let's modify the Y value to be 16
and then the blur value.
It's usually best to be
at least double the Y value.
And you can use a negative spread
value to make the shadow look more
realistic because it will kind
of contract it under the card.
So this is one very simple way
to make nice looking drop shadows.
But of course, it's not the only one.
So I'm gonna decrease the height
of my card to about 150 and then I'm
gonna duplicate it and move it down.
Having the bottom card selected
and holding the alt key, I can
hover over the top card and then
use the arrow keys to move it
to be 24 from the first card.
Now remove the shadow from this
card completely using
the minus sign, and let's create
a completely new rectangle.
Now, this is the tricky part.
Using the color picker, pick
the shadow color of the first card.
Just pick it next to the card
as close as possible.
Then add an effect to it as well.
But instead of the drop
shadow, choose Layer blur.
You might have to play around
with the blur value a little bit
to find one that works.
As you can see, 100 is
a little bit too much.
Even if you increase the size of
the object, it's just barely visible.
So I'm just gonna go with 40 here.
Now, to make things a little bit
clearer, let's select each of
the cards and then rename the layer.
So the first card is gonna be card one.
Then the second one is
gonna be card two.
And then the new rectangle that
we just created is gonna be the
shadow, and I'm gonna add a 2
next to the shadow name so we
know that it belongs to the
second card.
The first step is to move it
below the card itself on the layer
list and then move it below
the card on the actual frame.
That way you'll have a shadow that
only exists at the bottom of this
frame and it looks a little bit
more natural and kinda nicer.
When you found a combination that you
like, you can group them and rename
the group to card with shadow.
The biggest advantage to using these
kinds of shadows with your card
is that you can modify it a lot
easier because it's more visual.
So if you want the shadow
to be stronger, you can modify
the opacity or you can just
simply make that rectangle,
the shadow rectangle, higher.
You can also round the corners
so that the blur is gonna actually
round on the edges as well.
So it's a lot easier to just play
around with this and find a scenario
that you particularly like.
In many cases, having that new
rectangle be exactly in the middle
of the bottom edge is one
of the best approaches
for a natural looking shadow.
And contrary to popular belief,
this effect actually can't be done
in code because a developer
can create an extra object
under the main card and blur it.
Or of course, it takes a little
bit longer and it's a little
bit more difficult, but in
some cases it results
in a much better looking shadow.
Okay, now let's duplicate
the playground and let's
talk about depth.
This is something that
many designers do wrong.
So to show it to you, I'm
going to remove the text
and remove the second card.
This doesn't have to be super
precise because we want to only
play around with the principle.
But I'm going to increase
the shadow blur.
So I'm going to go with 48
and then with Y value of 24.
So as you can see,
the shadow is a lot larger.
Now I'm making the cards smaller
so we can fit a grid of cards.
So like two columns of cards.
And I'm going to play around
with the sizes a little bit,
but they don't really matter.
The goal here is to have a grid of
cards basically, and when I'm happy
with the result, I'm just going to
duplicate that card and place it 32
from the right edge of the screen
and then duplicate both those cards
and we can actually move them a
little bit higher and then place
them below at the same distance,
which is 20 is between them from the
left and right.
So just move them to 20
from the top and bottom
and then duplicate it again.
And as you can see, we do have
a grid of items right now.
But the problem with that is that
the shadow from the higher item
is actually touching the lower
item, so they don't really look
like they are on the same plane,
and we don't really want that
effect.
It doesn't work most of the time.
So instead, we need to modify
the blur value to be smaller
and then the Y value to be
correspondingly smaller as well.
Big shadows with a lot of blur are
really good if we want to focus
our attention on one big object.
But if we have a lot of smaller objects
on the screen, it's best to go
with smaller shadows like this.
Whatever you do, avoid that shadow
overlap that I showed you.
So we never want the shadow from
the top card to fall on the bottom
card, unless it's intentional.
If it's a stack of cards,
then it may make sense.
Okay, now let's play with some colors.
I'm just gonna click
on the first playground frame,
and I'm gonna duplicate it.
Ctrl D on, Windows
and Command D on the Mac.
And let's change
the background color here.
So I'm just gonna use the hue
slider here to go with something
a little bit more green.
But of course, both the font that
we used and the shadows are
not really matching the font.
So what we can do here is to actually
go back to that background click,
click on the background color
and copy the value of the hue, which
is the first value here, 76.
Then click on the font, and then
just paste that 76 into the hue.
And as you can see, we have a font
that's just as dark, but has a hint
of that green color that we wanted.
The difference here is, of
course, barely noticeable, but there
is one, and it's really important
to take care of that.
And we do the same with
the shadow color of the card.
Just paste in the hue value.
And in here, let's select the rectangle
in the background, the blurred one,
and then paste the hue value to it.
And as you can see, we quickly
generated a version of this card view
that looks and works great with green.
And the best way to practice
this is to do a couple more.
So I'm just gonna duplicate
that green playground again,
and this time, I'm gonna move
the hue slider towards blue.
So something like this, for example.
And of course, let's select the hue
value and copy it to the clipboard.
And right now let's go to the font
color and paste that hue value.
Now go into the card, select the drop
shadow options, then open the color
and paste that hue value there.
Okay, and before we do any more
changes, let's zoom in a little bit,
because I want to show you how this
little difference actually Makes a big
difference because this shadow here
just looks bad.
It looks bad with that green color
with that blue background.
And if we just paste the hue, it looks
a lot more natural and a lot better.
So avoid mixing these colors
together because they rarely work.
It's best to have the shadow reflect
the background color in some way.
Okay, one more.
Let's duplicate it again,
and let's pick a more purple hue.
And as you can now see, those green
and blue shadows under the cards
look really bad on that background.
So let's start by copying the hue
value again and then pasting it
into the font color and then back
into the cards, back into the
shadow, to the shadow color, and
then paste the hue value there as
well.
And once again, let's not forget
about that blurred rectangle shadow.
So I'm just gonna go in there,
and I'm gonna modify that color
and paste the hue value here as well.
And, yeah, it looks a lot better.
While working with shadows, it's
really important to always remember
about doing those little changes.
Okay, let's try a little bit more
pink color again just one more time.
And as you can see, I'm just copying
the hue color, going to the font,
pasting the hue color, the.
Then going into the drop shadow
for the first card, pasting
the hue value, and then going
into the blurred rectangle
in the background there and pasting
the hue value there as well.
Now, I've done all these versions to
show you that, first of all, it's
pretty easy to create a version
that matches the style and color of
the app that you're trying to
build, but also to show you how
precise you have to be while
picking the shadows.
And of course, you can
modify the background colors
a little bit as well.
You can make them lighter.
Just avoid really dark colors for
this particular modern design style.
And as I changed the background color
for the green one just now
to a little bit more lighter one,
I'm gonna modify the shadow
colors as well to match that.
And this is to show you that when you
modify a global thing like the
background color of this entire frame,
it's important to always remember that
the shadows that are being cast onto
that background color need to be
modified as well.
Don't leave them to the previous
values, because they just
might not work with that color.
Okay, to revise the hierarchy of the
shadows one more time, I'm gonna
duplicate that very first
playground, and then I'm gonna move
it to the bottom of our list so
it's a new row that we're Gonna
work with here.
And in this new screen, I'm
gonna select that first card
with the standard added shadow
and I'm gonna remove it.
Now I'm gonna move our, new card,
the one with the blurred shadow
underneath that, to the top
a little bit, and then I'm going
to increase the size of it.
If you have a large card like
this, that's usually a very important
message of some kind.
It's really good to actually
show a little bit more depth.
So to achieve that, you can
increase the size
of the shadow, but also the blur.
So I'm just going to go with 80 here.
And as you can see, this card now looks
a little bit more raised a little
closer to the user, which actually
catches more attention because we
naturally focus on the things that are
closer to us.
And just to show you the difference,
I just duplicated this screen
with the large shadow and decreased
the size of the shadow.
And as you can see, this new
card actually looks a little
bit further in the back.
To make this effect even more
visible, I'm just gonna select
the shadow here and I'm gonna decrease
the blur back from 80 to 40.
And with that simple change,
we have a card that's
further back in the screen.
So it's not really trying
to catch our attention.
It's not really super important
information, which can work
well if you have multiple car.
So I'm just going to decrease
the height of it, and then I'm
going to copy and paste it
and just create a couple of these
cards next to each other.
So as you can see in this view,
they make a little bit more sense
with a smaller shadow.
With a couple cards being close to each
other and having the bigger shadow,
they would overlap with the shadows
onto the cards and it would
look messy and it would look wrong.
So just remember to only add the big
shadows to one item per screen.
It's just the best approach.
If you add it to more items,
the whole screen becomes a little
bit harder to process because
there's just too much vertical depth
information for us to process.
And of course, it's all about tweaking.
So after a while, if you continue
to look at this shadow
and you believe that something is
not quite right there,
you can modify the opacity of it.
You can modify the blur value or modify
the height of the blurred rectangle.
Just make it look good.
Okay, let's duplicate that
first playground and move it
to the next row.
And right now let's play
with inner shadows.
So I'm just gonna change the title
of the screen accordingly.
I'm gonna call it Inner Shadow Tips.
But it doesn't really matter because
as we previously established, these
text fields are there to give a little
bit more context to the cards.
Now, for playing with inner
shadows, let's modify the background
of this whole frame.
Let's go away from the saturated
yellow and let's go with
something a little bit more blue.
So I'm just going to drag the hue
slider to a, blue that I think that
it's going to be okay for this.
And of course you can
modify it later as well.
But of course, as usual, to match
everything, I'm just going to
copy the hue value of that new
blue in the background, paste it
into the font, and as you can
see, we've been keeping our fonts
pretty dark in this lower left
quadrant here.
But of course you can move them
a little bit more to the center, just
not too far, so there can be a little
bit more blue in the dark gray.
Okay, now let's go into our card
and let's just change this entire
card color to blue as well.
So I'm just going to enter
some values just to check.
I'm going to use the same
hue, but different
saturation and lightness.
Okay, now let's create a gradient
and I'm going to go with linear here.
So the first thing that I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna click on one of the
edges of the gradient and move the
Alpha, to 100% and then simply move
the hue slider next to the first
one.
So basically want them very close.
We don't really want to have
the gradient all over the place.
The farther the colors are
from each other, the worse
the gradient is gonna look like.
So as you can see, when I'm
switching colors, that little dot
there just jumps a little bit.
And we want it to be very
close on each side.
And then I'm gonna modify
the gradient to be diagonal
because they look a little bit
more natural in most cases.
For this effect, I'm also
gonna increase the corner
roundness from 16 to 32.
But overall, don't try to go above 32
for most of your designs because it's
really difficult to make those even
more rounded corners to work well.
Okay, Having our rectangle selected,
add an effect to it, but change
the drop shadow to an inner shadow.
Now let's play around with some values.
We want to have a nice three
dimensional natural look.
So I'm going to go with negative
eight for both x and Y
and then a small blur of around 16.
And as you can see, it adds that little
bit of the 3D effect to it already.
Now, change the color of that shadow
using the color picker and click
near the bottom of the gradient
where it gets the darkest.
And of course, you can still
decrease the brightness of it
by just moving this dial down.
And if you want the effect to be even
stronger, you can double the values.
So minus 16 and a blur of 32.
But that's just one part of the story.
To make this object look better,
let's add another effect to it.
So just click into the card again
and add an effect.
And of course, by default, it
adds a drop shadow, but we
wanted another inner shadow, so
the first one is minus 16.
So now let's add 16 and 16, 16 and,
of course, 32 to the blur value.
Now, the main difference here is
that we're gonna use white for
that color, and we can add a
little bit more transparency or
a little bit less transparency,
depending on what the effect
looks like.
Okay, it looks pretty good.
So let's zoom out a little bit,
and let's go into the screen where
we had a blue background,
and where we used a blue rectangle,
blurred one for the shadow.
And I'm gonna copy it, and I'm
gonna paste it onto this screen.
And as you can see, this
color is not quite right.
So let's start by modifying it first.
So once again, I went into
the background color, copied the hue
value, which is 191, and then
pasted it into the shadow.
And make sure that the shadow is
below the card on the layer list,
and then simply move it under it.
And this can make sense, but it's
a little bit busy because we
have an inner shadow that's inside
the card, and there is also
an outer shadow that it's casting.
So in this case, it's actually better
to use a slightly more colorful
shadow that you can pick yourself
from the bottom of that rectangle.
And of course, we need a slightly
larger blur and a, lower opacity.
And you can modify the size
of the object as well.
So if you want a shadow
for an effect that actually has a lot
of inner shadows to it, it's really
best to go with something that's
a little bit more subtle.
And to hide that shadow below the card
a little bit more, we can decrease
the width of it to actually match
the corner radius of that minecart.
And, of course, you can also
just increase the height of
the shadow so it disappears a little
Bit more in the center.
And this is also something that you
really need to play around with
a little bit more to better understand
how it works and why this effect
can even make sense for you.
It can work in some specific cases,
like a huge card like this that's
in the center of the screen.
But at the same time, it can also
be a little bit too much if your
card already has inner shadows.
So it's all up to you to decide.
Just don't go overboard with effects.
Don't use too many effects
in one object or on one screen,
because this is what's gonna make
the screen messy and cluttered.
We want a very simple,
subtle look here.
And after tweaking the shadow some
more, when I zoomed out, you can see
that it looks a lot better than
the very first version that we had.
I believe that with high
fidelity effects like this,
it's all about the constraints.
So not going too far with the shadows,
we don't want them to be too
strong, too prominent, too visible.
Okay, now let's duplicate that
card and let's make a version of it
of that inner shadow that has
a solid color inside it,
and it's actually filled with white.
So we want a white card floating.
It looks kind of like our clay
mockups that you can also
download with this course.
Okay.
But we need to modify those inner
shadows because they look bad.
So I'm gonna start with the light one.
And of course, a white shadow
on a white background
is not gonna be visible.
So I'm just gonna pick a very
light blue for that top corner
of this inner shadow.
And then let's go to the other
shadow, which is the darker blue.
And what we can do here is to just
decrease the opacity of that color.
So it's still a little bit
darker than the one on the top.
But you can decrease the opacity
and decrease the X and Y value and of
course, the blur accordingly.
And now we have the same effect that's
applied to a completely white card.
Of course, this card can also cast
a blue shadow because the background
is blue and the shadow is
mostly a mix of what the card
is casting and the background.
But I'm gonna decrease the saturation
of that shadow so it's even subtler.
And as, you can see, this is
starting to look pretty good.
We will get into decoration
a little bit later.
But I want to show you something
when it comes to inner shadows.
So let's create an oval here
using the O key, and then let's
right click on A rectangle
and copy the properties of it.
Then right click on that oval,
then go to Paste and Paste Properties.
And, as you can see, we created an oval
that actually has the same effect.
So we can duplicate it a couple
times, make them different
sizes and distribute
them around the main card.
And as you can see, it's starting
to look like a screen that
actually has some stuff going on.
And we just used a couple of simple
shapes and simple techniques here.
Now, because the card can be
a main element of the screen,
while the actual dots are just
decoration, we don't really
want shadows under them.
So they just have that
inner shadow effect.
And I'm gonna just copy them
to the first screen and then copy
the properties of the blue card.
And we can try a different alignment
of them here as well.
Just to show you that with just
a very few simple tips and techniques,
you can modify those screens
to look a lot more interesting.
Just make sure that those extra
decorations that don't have any
function don't have a shadow, because
that would be just too much.
A lot of the things that we're
doing here, like picking the right
color combinations or when
the saturation or a contrast is
too high or not high enough,
comes from years of experience.
But there are some tips and techniques
that you can try and use.
So I'm just gonna show you one.
I'm gonna create a new rectangle
outside the frame, and I'm gonna
pick the color of the blue card.
Then let's duplicate that rectangle,
and let's pick the color
of the top shadow, the light shadow
that's on the top of the card.
Then let's move it to the bottom,
and let's pick the color for this from
the darkest part of this card.
And as, you can see, we have
three colors, so let's see what
the difference between them is.
So first I'm just gonna create names
for each color so you'll be able
to understand what they are.
The first one is the element, then
the color below that is the dark
shadow color, the dark inner shadow.
And then the element
on the top is the light or
the glow or the highlight.
Now, I'm going to show you something,
because what we can do here
by having those three colors like this
is we can try to find a pattern.
We can try to find where is the good
sweet spot of these three values
of the hue, saturation, and brightness
for each of these colors.
So how much lighter should
the light glow be from the main
element color, and how much darker
should the shadow color be.
So I'm just going to select everything
and move it a little bit to the side.
And what we're gonna do now is
I'm gonna copy those values.
So just gonna copy the text
here, paste it on the right
side, and it's 293 and 95.
So I'm just gonna type
in those number values.
And once you have these numbers, let's
just duplicate another text field.
And let's add the numbers
for the light glow.
I'm adding some spaces between
the numbers, so they are
pretty much in the same column.
And let's do the same thing
with the dark shadow.
Okay, now we're gonna see some patterns
here, because as you can see,
the hue of the main element is 200.
Then the hue for the dark shadow
and the light glow only change by 4 to
5 and avoid bigger changes than that.
So a, change between
three and five is optimal.
And the saturation for the dark shadow
is actually pretty much the same.
The brightness is obviously lower,
but it's only about 15 lower.
Then for the light glow, we don't
really play with the brightness
because it's really high already.
So we play with the saturation,
because the lower the saturation
then the lighter the color.
So small difference in hue, bigger
difference in saturation for the
light glow, and bigger difference
in brightness for the shadow, and
you'll be fine with selecting a
different color set altogether.
Before you go any further, please
practice some inner shadow tips
on a different color set.
So you can try orange or green.
Just create a couple of these so
you're comfortable and use the same
effect and the same calculations.
Okay, let's duplicate it again,
and let's remove the circles first.
And now let's get to the gradients.
Gradients are like the new
colors because everything
in nature is actually a gradient.
If you look at things that are around
you, you probably notice that
nothing is really like a solid one.
Color gradients make the important
UI elements, like buttons,
look a little bit more natural.
So we're gonna make a button first.
I'm gonna remove all the inner
shadow effects of our shape, and then
I'm gonna decrease the height.
And of course, it already was
a gradient, but let's switch it back
to a solid color for a minute.
So I'm just gonna click into
the color and then click
on linear and change it to solid.
Okay, we have a starting
point for a button here.
Now let's switch it back
to linear, and it creates the default
kind of gradient where
one end is a full solid color.
And the other is fully transparent
of that same color.
So let's bring the alpha, back up.
And once again, I changed the hue value
by just a couple of points.
So the colors are very close together,
and I'm making them diagonal.
And always make sure that the darker
color is more towards the bottom.
If you're making a diagonal
gradient kind of like this.
Now let's duplicate it and play
with some more versions of this.
Since our background is in the light
blue color, we're gonna play
with only the shades of blue.
But I'm just going to move the hue
for both colors a little
bit more to the right.
And as you can see, we have
two completely different blue
gradients, but the darker color
should be, at the bottom.
So I'm just going to go and edit
the gradient and just slide that
color down to the bottom and slide
the light one to the top.
And now it looks a lot better.
Of course, in a real project, you're
going to choose just one main CTA
color, but I'm just going to show you
a couple of different versions of how
you can play around with blue
gradients.
So I'm just going to duplicate this one
more time, and then I'm going to make
sure that they are 32 points apart.
So just going to bring
them all together.
Now, let's modify the colors
of the last gradient by selecting
each one and then moving the hue
a little bit more to the right.
Just make sure that there's still
a difference between the colors.
And then the darker one is actually
on the bottom or bottom left.
Because as we previously established,
all gradients look really
the best when the value difference
between the hues is not that big.
So aim for a difference
of between 20 and 30 points.
Of course, if you go below 20,
the gradient might be invisible.
Okay, now let's do some
more color practice.
So, I'm gonna duplicate the screen
with the three buttons, and let's
change the background color of that
screen to the desaturated yellow that
we have in the screens above.
So after duplicating the Playground 11
screen, I'm just gonna go back to
Playground 8, go into the fill color,
and let's change HSB to hex, because
it's gonna make it easier to copy.
Then copy the hex code, go back there
and paste it, and that way we have
a new background in Playground 12.
Now we need to, of course,
adjust the hue again.
So click back to HSB and the Hue is 47.
So copy 47, go into the text
and paste the hue there.
And I'm going to do it with every
single iteration in these exercises
because it's really important
to always remember about this.
Okay, now let's modify our button
gradients to match the new background
to make it easier with duplicating
later, I'm gonna select the bottom
two buttons and just remove them.
And let's start with the first one.
So let's go to the first color,
and then move the hue slider
towards some orange color.
And what some designers try
to do, and it's called brutalism in
design, and especially in gradients,
is to try to create those
very weird gradient combinations.
But in reality, it's really
difficult to pull that off.
So let's go with a gradient with
two colors that have hues that
are pretty close to each other.
So in our case, it's
gonna be 50 and 40.
And as you can see, this gradient
looks pretty good, pretty
natural, and the colors don't
really clash in any way.
So let's duplicate the button.
And now, let's change one of the colors
to a lower value, 30,
for example, because that's gonna make
the gradient be more on the left side
and then 45 on the other end.
So I'm just aiming between
10, 15, or 20 difference in the hue.
And you can do it one more time.
So let's just go with 20.
And then for the other color, let's go
with a slightly larger number, 35.
You can try 30 if it looks
good for some colors.
And with that simple technique,
we created three gradients
that work really well
on that particular background.
That's because the hue values
of those gradients
are very close to the hue value.
They're all around it to the hue
value of the background.
Now let's try to add some inner
shadow to one of the buttons
to see how it looks like.
And we're gonna use the same technique
as we used the last time, but we're
gonna use slightly lower numbers.
So we're gonna go with 4 and 4
in x and y, and then 8 for the blur.
And to have the 3D effect, we want
to go with a lighter color.
So white for the top left, inner
shadow, and then for the bottom right,
we're gonna go with negative 4 for
the x and y, and then 8 for the blur.
And let's pick a color from one
of the darker orange hues that we
already have and just simply decrease
the brightness a little bit.
You can go with just 10 or
maybe 20 if it looks good.
And, of course, if you want, you can
also modify the inner shadow values
to be slightly larger for your buttons
so it blends in a little bit better.
Or you can increase the opacity
of the white color to have a bit
more of that 3D plastic effect.
Just try to never go above 50% because
that's gonna just make it look bad.
Then to make it even subtler, you
can actually modify the darker color
to be 50% opacity as well, so it
blends better with the background.
And try not to use blending modes.
Of course, you can always experiment.
So I'm gonna go with 30
for this particular button.
As long as nothing is
too strong, it works.
So now let's add some inner shadows
to the blue button so we get
more comfortable in doing this.
And I'm go with minus 8 or minus 8
for both the X and the Y
and then 16 for the blur.
That's gonna make the button
a little bit more rounded and a little
bit more three dimensional.
For the darker part of the inner
shadow, I'm gonna pick the darker
blue from the gradient itself.
And then I'm just gonna modify
the brightness a little bit.
So just slide it down a tiny bit.
And now let's add
the second inner shadow.
So switch the drop shadow
to inner shadow.
And now let's add, positive values so 8
for the X and Y and 16 for the blur.
And let's change that shadow color
to white and we can keep it at 25%.
And, as you can see, this
button instantly stands
out from all the rest.
So if you want a very strong
cta, you can try this.
If you want that effect to look
even more subtle, you can
modify the blur value to be 32.
That will make the roundness stay,
but it's gonna be kind of blending in
with the button a little bit better.
But still, if you want one CTA
to stand out from this entire page,
this is one way to do it.
Because when you Zoom out,
those 3D buttons stand out a lot
more than the other ones.
Okay, but how do you really
practice these things?
Because obviously they need time,
they need some more practice,
and you need to create many different
cards and shadows and buttons
to actually get good at it.
Well, here is one idea.
Once you already know the
techniques on how to create a
nice looking shadow with both
the blurs and the right colors
and the right gradients, you can
find a dribble shot that you
particularly like.
But make sure that it's also a
pretty popular one, because that
usually means that the gradients
There or shadows are done right,
then copy it, paste it into the
design tool, and try to recreate
the.
Just the background and the card.
So don't really recreate
the entire dribble shot.
I, copied and pasted one of our
dribble shots that Diana did.
And of course this is diagonal.
So first thing that we want to do here
is to rotate it a little bit so
it's going to be easier to recreate.
And of course if a shot is
created that way, it doesn't
have to be super precise.
We don't really want to have like a,
completely one to one version
of that shadow or that card.
We want something similar.
We want to learn how to easily be able
to recreate an effect that we like.
Because when we start looking
for inspiration, we'll be able
to actually use some of the shadow
or gradient values that we want.
So I'm just gonna create a new
rectangle, make it a little bit
transparent, and I'm gonna place it
a little bit over that element that's
floating here in the dribble shot.
And then let's round the corners
until they kind of match.
And of course they're never
gonna match it completely with
the roundness and the rotation.
And.
But as close as we can get is fine.
So once the shape is roughly
complete, let's move it above
so it's on the same background
just above the main card.
Let's pick the same color
for the background here as
the main card has, and let's
increase the opacity to 100%.
So now it looks like it's
a similar shape to the first one.
So let's recreate a drop shadow.
First thing that I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna pick the color
where the original shadow
blends with the background.
Then let's increase the values
until we see something similar.
So first let's play with
the Y value only and then
start increasing the blur.
And if you have them side
by side, you should be able to find
a spot where this looks pretty
similar to the original.
It doesn't have to be a hundred percent
the same, but this is showing you
a technique where you can actually
be able to find effects that you like
and just simply recreate them.
And by creating a lot of those
different shadows and different cards
and different backgrounds,
different kinds of buttons, that way
you're gonna learn the most.
And if you're just starting out, it's a
great exercise to do daily because
just to recreate a card in a
background or a drop Shadow or a
button doesn't take a lot of time, but
it still gives you the skills and the
eye to actually be able to then spot
those differences and be able to be
creative on your own.
And knowing what you know about
gradients, shadows and inner shadows
and backgrounds, right now you should
be able to find similar looking
projects on Dribbble or Behance or
everywhere else that you look, and
you'll be able to actually learn from
them a little bit more, because that's
the best way to try and replicate
existing projects and then simply
start implementing things like that,
things that you've implemented or
played with or tested in your own
projects.
So once we start building the app
in the later part of the course,
we're going to play around
with this a little bit more.
For now, I'm going to take that
rotated dribble shot with the new card
and drag it a little bit outside.
And let's do one more color
for the playground, just so
we remember the whole process
and don't skip any steps.
So this time for the main
background, I'm gonna pick the
purple and then of course go into
that color, copy the 267 hue
value and then paste it first
into the font and then let's
paste it into the button.
And of course you can paste it on
both sides or simply add a little
bit to the other value, but I'm
gonna paste it on both sides and
simply increase the hue value
here.
So.
So I'm just gonna type in a larger
number into the second color.
And as you can see, we already have
a gradient that looks pretty good.
But once again, if it's a lighter
color, you can also decrease
the saturation a little bit
to boost the gradient.
And I'm gonna repeat it again.
Every difference between two elements
here has to be very minimal.
So don't ever go over the top.
All those changes that we're
making are 10, 12, 15, maybe
20 points on the values.
Okay, I made two more
copies of our buttons.
They are aligned perfectly
at 32 points from each other.
And now we can simply start adding
to the hue value again, still keeping
around the purple or violet territory.
I'm just gonna add a little bit
of hue to the main color
and then of course add a little
bit more to the second one.
And here is another matching color
that just works with that background.
But of course you can also play
around with the saturation here.
So just decrease it to make
the second color even lighter.
And for the third button, let's go
in the other direction.
So I'm just gonna select it, go,
into the gradient, and then just
drag the slider more to the left.
So it's gonna go like
240something or 250something.
So for the left edge, I'm gonna go with
250 and then let's modify the other
edge by just a couple of points.
So the difference is not really
huge because 273 is too much,
265 is a little bit better.
Okay, we're almost done here for today.
But in our previous two screens,
the last button on the list was
actually a little bit different than
the rest because it had an effect
on it like the inner shadows.
So to this one, let's add a,
drop shadow by just using
the blurred rectangle below it.
So I'm just going to duplicate this
entire button, make it smaller,
blur it, play around with the blur
values, and on the layer list
I'm just going to drag it down.
And in my case this shadow is
a little bit dark because this
color itself is pretty dark.
So I'm just going to play around
with it a little bit.
I'm going to decrease the size of it,
or increase, increase the height
just so we end up with an effect
that's not too over the top.
It doesn't have to be very
strong or very dark.
And of course we can also decrease
the opacity to about 50%.
We want to achieve a similar level
of visibility that we're having
throughout this entire exercise.
So as you can see, this is
starting to look pretty good.
Okay, now let's get to the very last
exercise because obviously you'll
never really gonna have three buttons
that are that strong on one screen.
That just doesn't make sense.
You need one cta and if you have other
buttons, they're gonna be secondary.
So let's select both three
frames and duplicate them.
So copy and paste them
and let's drag them underneath.
Okay, let's keep just the first
button in every single case.
So let's remove the buttons 2 and 3
on every screen and now let's
modify the text on the top
of it because it's not about gradients
anymore, it's about buttons.
So I'm just gonna go with buttons.
Done.
Right.
And I'm just gonna change it
in every one of them.
But of course you can pick any text
you want and you can pick something
funny or quirky if it makes it easier
for you to remember these techniques.
Okay, now let's start adding a,
classic drop shadow to those buttons.
I'M just gonna click plus
on the effects and then go
into the effects.
Use the color picker to pick
the darker color of our button.
And then let's decrease
the brightness a little bit.
I'm gonna go 20 down, so it's
gonna be from 95 to 75.
Then for the Y value, I'm gonna go
with 12 and 24, which is
double the value for blur,
and then negative 8 for the spread.
And this button Is looking
pretty good, but of course it's
a little bit too visible.
So let's decrease
the opacity down to 50%.
Now here is a trick to make
a nice matching secondary
button from this one.
So let's just make a copy
and place it at 32 points below,
just so we have some consistency
with the outer margin.
And let's remove the shadow
because basically the shadow is
something that should be reserved
for the main object.
So not all buttons should have shadows.
Now let's change the color to solid.
And here's the trick.
Using the color picker, pick the color
of where the shadow begins
to show from under the button above.
And it took me two tries
to actually click that.
But, as you can see, we have this nice
desaturated color that is actually
nice because it complements the main
gradient, but it's not too over
the top, it's not too visible.
Okay, let's do the same thing
to the orange button.
So first of all, let's add a shadow.
And as usual, I'm going to go
with 12 and 24, but you can try
16 and 32, for example.
And then let's click into the color
of this little gradient.
And again, using the color picker,
just pick the darkest shade of that
gradient for your shadow color.
And then decrease the brightness by 20.
If the color is still too bright
and doesn't look enough like
a shadow, you can also play
around with the saturation.
So decrease it a little bit and also
decrease the opacity to 50%.
Okay, once again, let's
make a secondary button.
So I'm gonna duplicate this one
and I'm gonna move it down.
Let's place it at 32 points again.
So just holding the alt key, I'm gonna
move it up, then click into the button
itself and change it to a solid color.
If you accidentally add the shadow
to the group like I did here, not
to the rectangle, you can just click
on the group and go to the shadow it.
Okay, now let's go into the color.
And using the color picker,
let's pick where the shadow
begins under the main button.
And as you can see, it's
another nice color that matches
the background and matches
the button, the primary one.
And of course, the main difference
here is that the text on these
lighter buttons has to be pretty
dark, because if some people are not
able to see that button because it's
not contrasting enough with the
background, they're still going to be
able to see the dark text on that
background and know that it's a link
and that they can click it.
But this is just the starting point.
Of course, we'll explore buttons
a lot more in depth while we'll be
building our project screens.
Okay, let's take care
of the last button.
So I'm gonna go back
to the last screen, and I'm gonna
add the drop shadow to it.
So click on the effects and the
plus again, then click on the
sun icon, and I'm gonna go with
12 and 24, but you can use 16
and 32 or 8 and 16, whatever you
wish.
And again, let's pick the color
for our shadow from the darkest
color of the gradient and then
move it two notches down.
So.
And of course, you can also decrease
the saturation a little bit.
And as with most shadows, go
with 50% opacity or less.
Okay, now it's gonna be
the same technique again.
So let's duplicate this
button or copy and paste it.
Place it 32 points from the first one.
And this is also important.
We're just playing with colors
and shadows here, but the positioning
we always have to do.
Right?
So change the gradient to solid,
and once again, pick the light
color from where the shadow starts
from the previous button.
And this button doesn't have
a shadow, but it looks really nice.
It complements the first one.
And if you use a darker font
on it, it's gonna be accessible.
So that way you have two buttons
that work together very well.
And I believe the next step should be
for you to find a couple of dribble
shots or behance projects to recreate
just the cards or just the buttons.
And after a while of doing this,
you'll be able to do these
things pretty automatically.
So you won't have to remember about
the rules of adding 20 to saturation
or subtracting 20 from brightness.
So all these things were just
gonna be second nature for you.
But the main thing to remember here
is that for the effects to look
good, they need to be subtle.
So we don't want strong shadows
that are very dark or very blurry.
We don't want gradients between
colors that are far away from
each other, and we don't want
shadows that are overlapping.
The card all has to blend in together
nicely and has to be subtle.
I'm just gonna repeat it once again
because this is the most important
part about high fidelity design.
Don't go over the top.
And I'm gonna see you
in the next lesson soon.
Hi.
Welcome to another set
of high fidelity exercises.
Before we get to the actual screens,
let's start by creating a new page.
And for now, I'm not gonna name
it because this is not gonna
be our main project today.
We're gonna make a huge frame
and create a lot of different
components, but they're not
gonna be like true components.
So I'm just gonna call
this Artboard Components.
But for real, they're gonna be design
elements that you can use later.
So things like buttons, things like
checkboxes, things
like toggles, and more.
I'm not gonna get into the typical
design system components set
and how to do those because that's out
of scope for this course.
So I'm just gonna copy
and paste two of my buttons.
And if you created a couple
more buttons in your first
exercise, you can just pick the two
that you like the most.
Now let's create another
shape just for a second here.
And I'm gonna make it 300 by 44,
because as you can see, 44 is like
the minimum height of the button.
So if you can change the color
to something else, you'll
be able to see it better.
44 is the minimum, but you
can go with 50 or even 60.
Over 60 is probably too much.
My buttons are pretty much always
60 or 54 or 56 because I like them
big and I like them very actionable.
But of course, if it's in the range
of 44 and 60, you should be fine.
Okay, let's create a nice
looking shadow using the effect
from the previous video.
So I'm just gonna blur this
whole shape and of course increase
the blur value and then simply put it
under the button.
Okay.
The most important thing
on the button is the label because it
tells us what the button does.
So let's add a label here.
And first I'm gonna move the buttons
a little bit higher to the top.
So I'm just gonna click into that group
and using the text tool, I'm
just gonna type in Create account.
Now the age old question is,
what size should this text be?
So if our button height is 60, it's
best to actually go with the number
that's one third of that.
My main rule is to create
the capital letter W in that font size
that you already picked and see
if it fits under the font.
You know, if it's rotated 90 degrees,
if it fits under the font
and above the font, and we're aligning
to the capital letters, not
to the ascenders, and descenders.
So if it works this way, it's fine.
Of course, you can go
with a smaller font.
It doesn't have to be 1W, but make
sure there's enough space to optically
make that label stand out.
And also the space on the sides.
I have the same rule for it,
but this time I think it's better
to fit at least two W's.
But fitting just one is,
like the bare minimum.
So just add a W and then see if it fits
on the side of the text here.
But if a button is condensed
like that, it's really hard
to actually read that text.
So I'm gonna increase the width
of the button by just resizing it.
And as you can see, it fits
double W's on every side.
And this is sort of like the best
rule to actually have
proper white space on your buttons,
because obviously some of them are
going to be a little bit smaller.
It's just how it is with apps.
And a lot of the main CTAs
in mobile apps actually take most
of the width of the phone.
So this is fine.
Like 300 or 310 or 320.
These numbers all work well, and I
would fit most of the labels.
And of course, to optically
align that capital letter
to the center of the button,
I'm gonna use some squares.
And as you can see, it's just
one pixel off, and it doesn't
really look that good.
So there are a couple
of ways to solve this.
You can increase or decrease
the font size by one, so
I'm just gonna decrease it.
And as you can see right
now, it's in the center.
Because all fonts render differently,
there is no rule to that.
You just need to add those squares
to optically align the font to match.
And of course, you can use
the Auto Align tool to horizontally
align it to the button.
And yeah, this button is starting
to look good, but we can still add
some more additional elements to it
that will make it more actionable.
So I'm gonna start by creating a circle
to make the CTA stronger.
You can add a little chevron,
facing right to the right side
of your buttons or your labels.
But we're gonna start with a version
on an additional shape.
So I'm gonna make sure that this
circle is four points from the top,
from the right, and from the bottom.
You can make the circle
smaller as well if you wish.
Just make sure that the distance
from those three sides is the same.
And now, using the Path tool, just
click once, then holding shift,
drag a little bit, and then
holding shift down, and it should
align into a perfect chevron.
And it works the same
in every design tool.
I'm going to pick the background
color from the button
for this, and I'm going to decrease
the brightness quite a lot.
What we want here is a dark shade
of almost black with
a little hint of our orange.
And of course, the line needs
to be thicker, so I'm going
to change that to two points.
And, yeah, this is starting
to look good.
Of course, we need to also align, this
arrow to the center of our circle.
And in this case, I need
to move it a little bit to the right
because more optical weight
of this icon is on the right.
So to be optically in the center, it
sometimes has to be tweaked manually.
One thing that we sometimes do is to
actually set the stroke width of this
icon to be the same size or similar
size to the stroke width of the text.
So as you can see the letter T
in account, it's just good
to try to have the same chevron
stroke width as that letter.
So two is definitely too thin,
and we can go with either 3 or
maybe just add 2.5 to match.
For now, I'm gonna leave it
at 2, though, because we're gonna
come back to this arrow later.
And what we can also do is
to add a very subtle little
shadow to that circle.
And of course, first pick the darker
shade of orange for the color
and then decrease the opacity to.
Let's start with 50%,
but always stay below 50%.
That's the goal.
So I'm gonna decrease the y value
to 2 and then the blur to 4.
And, yeah, this is starting
to look pretty good.
Now, if we're using a rather
bright button color, like orange
and white text on it, it's really
good to actually help that
text stand out a little bit.
So you can add a shadow to it.
But the shadows with text on buttons
should be very, very subtle.
So I'm just gonna go with a y
value of, 1 and then the blur
of 2, and I'm gonna pick
the darker shade of our orange.
So as you can see, it mostly stands out
on that light background
and blends in pretty well
on the darker part of the gradient.
But of course, for high fidelity
to make sense, your button doesn't
have to be dead over the top, so it
doesn't have to have all those
effects and all those gradients.
So I'm just gonna remove
the inner shadows from, it.
I'm gonna remove the shadow
from under it and I'm gonna
change the color to be a,
solid color instead of a gradient.
And sure, gradients work better
because they're a little bit more
friendly, but a solid color can work
just as well for the main CTA to have
the most impact though, it's best if
that color is pretty vibrant, like in
this case.
So, avoid colors that are too
subtle for the main buttons.
And for this button, let's
make a standard shadow.
So I'm gonna go into
the effects and add a shadow.
And of course let's
increase the blur first.
So 4 and 8 is a good start.
And then pick the darker color
from the background
and then go to the opacity.
It can be 50% or less.
And then we can switch to HSB
and then decrease the brightness.
And I usually decrease it
by two or three times with the shift
key, so 20 or 30 points.
And I like my gradients
to be a little bit bigger.
So I'm gonna pick 8 for the Y
value and 16 for the blur.
And if it's too heavy, you can
decrease the opacity even further.
So 30 or 40 or 20% even the shadow has
to be visible, but it can't be
too over the top or too strong.
Okay, so we have some very rounded
pill shaped buttons, but of course
that doesn't have to be the only way.
So I'm gonna decrease the roundness
of the corners to four or maybe eight.
Fully sharp corners aren't
really that user friendly.
I'm gonna go with eight.
So even a small roundness
still adds up to this effect.
That's kind of more positive
and more user friendly.
And I'm gonna paste in the text
from the previous button.
But obviously it can't stay like
that because that shadow
looks ugly on that background.
So I'm gonna use the color picker
and pick the color of the shadow
to be the darker shade of our blue.
But in this case it's not
really visible anymore.
So I'm just gonna go into the color.
And first of all, in the brightness,
I'm gonna decrease it by two.
And yeah, as you can see now,
the shadow is visible,
but it's not over the top.
It's not too saturated.
And of course you can go even lower.
You can go to smaller values.
But if you create a shadow like that,
it kind of destroys this entire
effect because it's too strong
and it just doesn't look good.
And shadows and buttons aren't
really that necessary.
Sure, they convert a little bit
better and they help bring the main
CTA more to prominence, but they're
not necessary if your button is
very visual heavy or very bright.
But still, we're gonna
add a small shadow to it.
And of course, as usual, I'm gonna
pick the darker shade of the gradient
that we already have on the button.
And then the blur is gonna be 16,
and then, the Y value is gonna be 8.
And of course we can use
a negative spread, so I'm gonna go
with negative four here.
And always make sure
to have the opacity lower
than 50% or equal to 50.
And in many cases, this is enough
to have a nice looking button for you.
But we also need to be sure that
the text label is in the center
of the button vertically, because this
is one of the most common problems.
So we're gonna use
two squares for that.
I'm gonna create one square
and position it at the bottom
and the other one at the top.
And as, you can see if the squares
are a little bit more transparent,
there's still a little bit of overlap
over the ladder, but it looks good.
It fits.
If the font goes beyond the full
pixels a little bit, just make sure
that it goes beyond the same amount
on every side and we'll be fine.
Okay, now I'm going to move that
button more to the top again
and I'm going to duplicate it.
And after we duplicate it, what we want
to do is to create a secondary button.
So first of all, let's remove all
the effects, because secondary buttons
don't really need any effects.
And then second of all, we
don't need a gradient either.
So I'm gonna change it
to a solid color.
And using the color picker, I'm
gonna pick the light shade
of blue from the shadow above.
And yeah, this is starting to look
pretty good because it shows
the hierarchy, it shows that
the Create Account blue button is more
important than the second button.
So the next thing that we want
to do is to change the font color
to our, darker shade of blue.
But there's still not
enough contrast here.
So let's go into the color
and into the brightness and decrease
it a couple of times.
Just hold the shift key
and use the up and down arrows
to decrease and increase
the values in those boxes.
And, yeah, this is looking
a little bit better.
So we're gonna change the text
to already have one login,
because we can also add most
of that copy onto the button.
And when we center this, there
is one more thing that's important
to do here to show that one
of this is a description
and the other is the action.
So I'm just gonna change it
to medium from extra bold.
And as you can see, the login
part is the actual action
on the button, and the other one is
just an additional description.
This will help the button feel
less heavy visually, so it won't
be fighting for attention
with the primary button as much.
And of course, we can use the 24x24
square on each side of the button
and then drag the size
of our text field to match it.
So that way the text field will
have 24 points on each side.
And once you center the text, it's
gonna be in the center again.
But what it's gonna give you
is the margin that you're
gonna have for the text.
So in case you have longer text, you'll
know how long can it be
before the button becomes unreadable,
and it's best for you then to actually
change the text to something shorter.
Now, this button is secondary,
but it can get even more
secondary if you want it to.
So I'm gonna duplicate it again.
And let's start with the background.
So I'm gonna go back into the color.
And.
And the first thing that we want
to do is to decrease
the saturation a little bit.
So let's go to almost
the corner, the top left corner
of the color palette.
And then you have that low saturation.
If you're just somewhere around here,
you should be fine to have this as
the secondary button, because it's
almost gray, but it still has a little
bit of that main color to it.
And then you can even decrease
the brightness and the saturation
of your text text.
So it's more in the center
of the color palette.
So these are the best two options
for secondary buttons.
Or if you have a set like this,
you can actually use it as
primary, secondary, and tertiary.
But in many apps, the tertiary button
can actually be just the text.
Okay.
But all of those buttons are
pretty wide, so let's create a version
of it that is a lot smaller
for, like a cancel button.
So I'm just gonna go into this
field and I'm gonna type in cancel.
And we can leave the medium weight
of this font because this is
not an important kind of button.
Of course it needs to be
readable and it needs to have
the right contrast, but it
doesn't have to be bold.
And of course we're gonna use
the two W's rule on the sides.
So I'm just gonna see how far
the button should actually stretch
outside of the cancel label.
So it's really easy.
You just duplicate the W's and then you
switch the button size to match that.
And I see that I duplicated it twice.
I'm just gonna delete that
from the background.
And now when you see that
the button size is pretty good, you
can delete the W's as well.
Okay, now let's get into
another part of the interface,
which is the forum fields.
And this is tricky because a lot
of people use the same height for
the forum fields as for the buttons.
And I don't believe that's
the best approach because the button
has to be bigger as it's
the final action of the form.
So if our button height is 60,
then it means that our form fields has
to be smaller than 60 in height.
So let's create a form field.
I'm gonna start by creating
a rectangle, and for now let's not
worry about the margins, but of course
those will influence the size of it.
So I'm just gonna change the size
of it to 320 by 44.
And some people go with 40 instead
of 44 for form fields because they are
are a little bit wider, so it's
not that difficult to actually tap
into them if they're smaller.
But I still would go with 44 anyway.
So let's change the background color
to white and let's add a stroke,
because rectangles with an outline are
still the best thing for form fields.
And using the color picker, I'm gonna
pick the outline color to be one of
those colors that we had in those
secondary buttons, but I'm gonna
decrease both the saturation and
brightness so the line is still very
visible.
Now, depending on the style of your
app, you might go with a one point
stroke of your form fields, but I'm
gonna go with two, because first of
all, they're more accessible and
more visible, but they also match
the playful style of a typical B2C
product.
So I'm gonna use the text tool to
add a label to it, but of course
the label can't be bold, so I'm
gonna change it to medium and to
the size of 14, and then I'm
gonna place it where I think it
should be.
And then let's pick the color
of the edge, so
of the border of the frame.
And.
Yeah, I picked wrong.
Let's do it again.
And depending on your font, this
text has to be either eight or maybe
16 points away from the frame.
But as you can see, I put it at eight
points on instinct, which is good.
And at some point, you'll be able
to actually align it on instinct as
well and just check it afterwards.
Okay, let's group this form field
and then duplicate it because
I want to show you a couple
of things just for some clarity.
I'm gonna change this field
to be the password.
And.
Okay, let's look at it.
Now.
It has 44 points, but what
happens if we go with 48?
It is a little bit better.
We can go with 50 as well.
So we have the email address,
which is 44, and then
the password, which is 50.
So let's bring in the create
your account button
next to the email address.
And as you can see, there is
a proper hierarchy
from the form field to the button.
The button is bigger, and it
actually shows that it's a button.
I moved the other button next to
the form field that is 50 points high.
And.
And it's still visible.
You can still see that the button
is the more important part of it.
Okay, now let's add some
annotations so we won't forget.
So I'm going to duplicate that text
and I'm going to type in 44, so
we know that this field is 44.
And then I'm going to type 50 into
this part because this field is 50.
And now let's duplicate this again.
So I'm going to bring
in the last button that we have
and duplicate the password field.
And I'm going to move it
over that last button.
But see what happens if I change
the size of the form field
to the same size as the button?
So, see, the button is 60,
and if I go into the height
of the form field and I'm going
to enter 60, it looks different.
It looks weird.
It looks like it's completely out of
proportion because the form field
is just as big as the button, so it
doesn't have that natural
progression through the smaller
steps to the final step that
confirms the action.
So don't do it this way.
Buttons should always be visibly
taller than the form fields.
That's the best rule.
Okay, now we can remove
those helper texts.
Okay, we have a nice arrow
on the orange button, so let's
create one for the blue one.
As well.
So what we're gonna do here is I'm
gonna create a rectangle first.
This is the main starting point, and,
actually it's gonna be a square.
So first of all, see, the distance
is holding the alt key, and we
want the that same 4 by 4
by 4 distance from each side.
And of course, this is
still a rectangle.
So I'm gonna make it a 52 by 52 square.
Okay, this is starting
to look pretty good.
So I'm gonna copy the arrow.
That's the first thing.
But then we need to change
the color of the background
of that square to be white.
And then let's see what happens if
we increase the corner radius.
And in some values, like if it's too
big, it looks weird in that frame.
And if it's too small, it also
looks weird because it just
doesn't have enough space
around the button to go to.
So it's best to always have the same
distance from every side,
from every angle, even diagonally.
So I'm just gonna paste
in that arrow to it.
And of course, I'm gonna pick
the darker shade of blue.
And as usual, I'm gonna decrease
the brightness a little bit.
We want a pretty dark arrow in most
cases, so this is one way of doing it.
But I still prefer to actually have
that white shape on the rounded
buttons so it doesn't look as well.
I'm gonna it.
And let's change the arrow
background color to white, and then
let's increase the height
of it a little bit so it's a little
bit taller now because there is
no background around it.
And we want it to match the letter
T at, the end of our text.
We need to increase the stroke width.
So I'm gonna go with three
for now, and I'm gonna bring it
back here a little bit closer.
And if the text on your button has
a shadow, then the arrow needs
to have a shadow as well, and it needs
to be similar to the text shadow.
So I'm gonna pick the color
from the darker side of the gradient,
and then I'm gonna play
around with the values.
So once again, decrease
the brightness a little bit
and decrease the opacity to 50%.
And just as with text, I'm gonna go
with a y value of 1 and blur of 2.
Okay, let's move the button down again,
and let's play with the alignment of
that icon because of course it can
stay on the right edge where it was,
but we can also bring it closer to the
text.
But how do we set the right distance.
So once again, our
trusty letter W comes to the rescue.
So if you place the capital letter W
between the arrow and the text,
you can see that this is probably
the good spacing for
a slightly larger space between them.
So in this case, it's just gonna work.
So now we can remove the W, select
both the arrow and the text, and group
them, and then just simply align
that group using auto alignment
to the center of the button again.
And this is one option that
can actually work quite well.
But it's not the only option.
So I'm gonna duplicate the button,
zoom in a little bit, and
basically what we want here is to
move it closer, and if you move
it to around 8 points, it should
be fine.
And this is a matter
of personal preference
and the font that you're using.
For some font, one option works
better than for the other.
And of course, you make sure to
align it horizontally and vertically
into the center of the button.
Okay, one last exercise
with the buttons and we'll move
on to something else.
So let's go into our orange button
and duplicate it and then move it down
to the very bottom of our list.
For this button, let's remove the
chevron, and just for now, let's
move that circle to the left side of
the button instead of the right,
because we can add some additional
visual to it that is gonna make it
look good.
And obviously what I meant was emojis.
So I'm gonna search for a thumbs
up emoji because that's
one that I use very rarely,
and I'm gonna add it here.
And of course, this can be on this
little white background that we have.
That's one way of putting it.
And it still makes the button
more original, more interesting,
and a little bit more user
friendly, because people
communicate with emojis a lot.
But that's just one way of doing it.
Let's switch that emoji back
to a, lightning bolt because we
want to show that creating
an account is super fast here.
And I'm gonna make it a tiny bit
bigger, but we're not gonna stop here.
So first of all, align this
and then duplicate this icon.
So this emoji, we just need it twice.
And then click on the one on
the layer list that's at the bottom.
You can move it outside a little
bit so you can still see it
and add an effect of the blur.
So layer blur or just blur in sketch
to it.
And anyway, you have a blurred
version of that one icon, you can
move it a little Bit under the
main icon, and that creates that
nice visual effect of that icon
blending in with the background
even better.
And if the blur is too strong,
you can decrease the opacity.
And as you can see, it's a very
easy way to quickly add a visual
to your button and make
it a lot more interesting.
Okay, one more thing.
Let's create a drop down list
because they're still important
even though they're not the best way
of showing information.
So I'm gonna duplicate one
of the form fields and here let's type
in country, because usually
the country list is a pretty long one.
And what we need here is a little
arrow pointing down that shows
that the dropdown can be opened.
But before we get to the arrow, here
is a nice trick to show you where
to actually place the arrow first.
So let's create a square, and let's
place that square on the right side
of the form field so it can be inside
the field, it can be over the borders.
That's all fine.
Now switch to the Path tool and then
holding the shift key, use diagonal
lines to create a triangle.
Now what we want to do is
to remove the stroke.
So just hide it and add a fill to it.
And the color of the fill needs to be
a slightly darker shade of the outline
of our form field so it matches.
So I'm just gonna pick it with
a color picker and then decrease
the brightness three times.
But it's not yet perfect because
all the edges of the triangle
needs to be the same length.
So make sure the proportions
are off like this one.
And now go into the width
of it and modify it.
So now all the sides are a little
bit more even and it looks
a lot better as this little
indicator that it's, a drop down.
Now it's time to place
it in the center.
But as you can see, in my case,
this shape doesn't
perfectly align in the center.
So I'm going to increase the size
of it in every direction.
So just make sure that you're not
gonna just increase the width or
the height alone, but both of them.
And that way that shape is still
proportional, but it's in the center.
And now we can hide that helper
square, but it's still best to
actually just decrease the opacity
than to remove it, because that way
you'll be always able to align that
arrow much better.
And of course, a good dropdown
needs a placeholder or
a selected item already.
So I'm just gonna type in one
of my favorite countries
in the Whole world and Estonia.
Now, because this is an actual option
that you can choose, I'm going
to change the weight of it to bold.
And then let's decrease
the brightness so it's even more
visible because it has to clearly
stand out from the label.
And of course we can also align
it using the red square method.
So simply, if you want to align
it better, just zoom in, create
a square that's 16 by 16
and then simply move this text
a little bit more to match and.
And that way it's 16 points
from the left side if we're
using an eight point grid.
Okay, but are there any other
ways to actually show those
form fields that are not just
a plain old boring border?
Yes, but I still believe that
for the most important elements
of a form, which are the form fields
and the buttons, we shouldn't
really experiment too much.
But of course there is this way
of doing the form fields with
the shadow instead of the border,
or the shadow and the border.
And of course this can work.
This can work pretty well and be nice
visually if it's not over the top.
So the shadow needs to be blurred
enough, it needs to be far
enough, and it needs to actually come
from the main color as well.
And of course you can turn
off the stroke as well.
So to have this kind of floating
effect on your foreign fields.
But then it's really not that
easy to actually do it right,
because first of all,
accessibility suffers quite a bit.
And also for many people it doesn't
really make sense that this whole
element is actually floating
even though you're typing into it.
It's just kind of counterintuitive.
So in most cases I'll just go back
to the stroke and turn the shadow off.
But you can still experiment it.
You can use the same techniques
from the previous video
on the effects to create a nice soft
shadow under the form field.
And if you like it that way,
just make sure that your
button also has that shadow.
But if you have a secondary button,
it shouldn't have a shadow.
Okay, now let's create a toggle.
And of course you can use the Native
toggles on iOS or Android for this.
But I believe that if we're making
a completely custom interface,
it's actually better to go fully
custom and only have the toggle
actually work the same way.
So I'm making a new rectangle with
fully rounded corners and 50 height.
And some people use the width
of it as 150% of the height.
So it's gonna be 75 in this case.
I Prefer a slightly larger number.
And I can actually show you the best
way that I think is to set it up.
If you're gonna make a completely
custom toggle, first create the
circle that's gonna be, you
know, the switch inside it and
of course, change that switch
color to a color that's gonna be
visible.
And as usual, because these elements
are pretty small, it's good
to have pretty big spacing inside.
So at least those four points way.
And make sure that the distance
from the top right and bottom, or
in this case from the top
left and bottom is the same.
So in this case, this
looks pretty good, right?
It looks like a toggle.
But how to see if the width
of the toggle is good enough?
Well, let's increase it
for now for a second.
And my goal for this is to actually
duplicate the circle inside it
and place it in the exact same spot.
And if these circles overlap just,
just barely, so they don't really
need to be too far away, but,
they need to overlap just a tiny
bit like this, then it works.
So if you're able to fit two circles
in two different positions inside
the toggle, then you're good.
Okay.
Just to make it easier, I'm going
to group it and call it
Toggle off, because that's
the toggle in the off state.
Okay.
The next thing that we want to do is
to change that boring gray
into a color that we already have.
But what we want to do with it is
to make it a little bit darker because
still accessibility
is really important and we want it
to look good and it's looking better.
It fits more with the theme of all
the other elements that we have here.
So let's duplicate it, move it
to the side, and let's
create the on state.
And I believe the best way to do it
is to actually go to our button
that has some effects and some
styling on it and then copy the
properties and paste them to the
on button.
And of course, make sure that
the roundness doesn't paste as well.
And if it does, just bring
it back to what it was.
And what we don't want here is that we
don't want an outer shadow for those
elements like toggles or checkboxes.
We don't want them having
shadows because it's just
going to be looking messy.
And we can also turn the white inner
shadow completely off because we
don't really want that full 3D effect.
If we just have the bottom one, it's
just going to look a lot better.
If you prefer it this way you can
actually switch it to the top.
So instead of the negative values
on X and Y, you can have a positive
and a smaller blur.
But I still prefer the negative
ones because I feel that it's just
gonna work a little bit better.
So I'm gonna go with minus four
and then eight for the blur.
And it just works.
It's kind of like a very simple
element, a very simple object.
But it looks good with that inner
shadow, so there's actually no need
to add an extra shadow to it.
But what we can do is to use
the Path tool and the shift key
to create a check mark.
That check mark can be like
a differentiator of your
boring toggle, so it just
doesn't look as boring.
And of course, I'm gonna change
the stroke width to 2.5, which is
closer to the text that we have here,
and make sure that you
align it optically in the center.
And of course, this is completely
optional, so you can actually skip
that part or you can add a sad
emoji to the toggle that's off and
the happy one to the toggle that's
on.
Whatever you wish, but just make
sure to make it interesting.
But still, even while making it
interesting, you need to remember to
always keep the accessibility in mind.
Okay, now let's create a checkbox.
And to use it, I'm just gonna
duplicate my dropdown and move it
a little bit to the bottom.
Now I'm gonna remove the label.
It's not gonna be necessary.
And we already have a label inside
that's gonna be working really
well next to the checkbox.
So first of all, let's decrease
the size of it to be a perfect square.
And before we talk about the sizes,
let's change the text here to say no.
So let's say that it's an option
and you're gonna choose no.
And as you can see, that checkbox is
completely dominating that text.
But we can't really make that text
bigger because the text of that size
is already inside the dropdown.
And if we make it bigger there as well,
it's gonna look pretty grotesque.
So for checkboxes, since both the label
and the checkbox are tappable
or clickable, you can actually
decrease the size of it to be 40.
And this is one of those
exceptions where it actually works
to be 40 and the distance
between them can be 16.
For example, if you're going
with an eight point grid,
that's a good starting point.
So now we can duplicate this as well
and create a checked state or
a selected state for the checkbox.
And since I like the style of our
toggle, I'm just gonna copy
the properties of that background
rectangle, the blue one, and then
paste it onto the checkbox.
And it's completely round
because it also copied
the roundness of the corners.
So it was four before.
And I'm gonna just enter four
into here, and it's gonna
be looking exactly the same.
Now you can copy the check mark that
you already created or use an icon
from an external library and then
just paste it onto the checkbox
and change the color to white.
And if you have a line shape like
that, you can always modify
the proportions pretty easily
by pressing Enter and then just
dragging one of the points.
But of course, if you're unsure
of that, just use an already
existing check mark icon
and just paste it it there.
In many cases, if you're making
a quick portfolio project, it's just
gonna be a little bit faster
to simply draw the icons from scratch.
Now, just to show you something,
I'm gonna create two rectangles
on top of that check mark.
And this is to show that there
is completely different weight
of that icon towards the bottom
where two lines meet, because
it's just simply heavier there.
So to align it better inside that
square, inside that blue check mark
square, it's really good to have it in
a place where you're sure that it's
optically centered, because if you
center it kind of automatically like a
computer does, it might not be
optically in the center because of how
that shape looks.
And of course, I'm gonna change
the label on it to yes.
And as I said before, having shadows
under the checkboxes or even
under the text is really a bad idea.
Because for most interfaces it's.
It just doesn't look good.
So if you add a drop shadow to your
check marks or to your checkboxes,
think about it this way.
You're adding complexity
to something that people only see when
they're filling up the form.
Okay, now let's create something else.
Let's create a slider.
Sliders aren't really that popular,
but it's really nice to actually
be able to use them sometimes.
So I'm gonna start by creating
a very narrow rectangle.
And.
And yeah, it's gonna be 320 as usual.
By, I'm gonna go with
maybe eight points.
And the next step is to select
the toggle in the off state and then
copy the properties of that
background shape and then paste them
into our New slider background.
Now, a slider has both the background
that fills up with a color and also
that draggable element that kind of
sets the value on the horizontal axis.
So I'm just gonna copy that little
circle from the toggle, and I'm
just gonna add a drop shadow to it.
Now let's go into the shadow
properties, and I'm gonna pick the
color of the shadow to actually come
from that background of that line,
and of course, decrease the opacity
of it to 50%.
And if you want, you can also decrease
the brightness a little bit as well.
And I'm gonna play around it until it's
visible, but it's not too visible,
because the actual indicator of
the state is not gonna be that circle.
This is just what you drag.
And it can be also
a little bit smaller.
So I'm gonna decrease
the size to 40 by 40.
Okay, now let's select the background
line and duplicate it,
and then just make it smaller so
it hides behind the circle.
And now let's again copy
and paste the properties
of one of our blue elements.
So I'm just gonna copy it
from the checkbox and then
paste them onto the line.
And this is one easy way to do toggles.
But of course, you can also
make it slightly more accessible
by adding a border of
of the same color as the form fields
to our draggable element.
And of course, I can make it a little
bit lighter, because when you zoom
out of it, when this is visible in,
like, the 100% view, it's just gonna
be barely visible, but it's gonna
add this little bit of fidelity and
a little bit of contrast to the
toggle.
So on a small screen, it's
still gonna be visible.
Okay, time to add some additional
elements to this list,
because there is a couple of things
that you use a lot, and one
of these things are tabs.
So I'm just gonna create
a couple of tabs with two
different versions for them.
So you can actually pick and choose
the right one for your app.
I'm gonna start by creating a rectangle
and changing the height of it to 50.
Okay.
Once this is done, remember to always
copy and paste the properties
of elements that you already have.
That way it's gonna be all consistent.
And of course, yes, you can create
variants and you can create
components, but this is all
beyond the scope of this course.
So I just want to show you
the easiest way to actually be able
to create a couple of elements
and still keep that consistency.
So I'm just gonna paste in that
color, remove the styling
and change the corner radius to 4.
Now I'm gonna move a copy of it
to the side and press Enter.
And once you press Enter, you'll able
to select individual corners.
So for the two inner corners,
I'm gonna change the radius to zero,
and I'm gonna do the same thing
for the second rectangle.
So we want the inner edges of them
to be able to actually connect
together kind of like this.
Okay.
The next step is to actually turn
off the fill and turn on the stroke.
So the first thing that I'm gonna do
with the stroke is
to change the weight of it to 2.5.
And then I'm gonna use the color
picker to pick one of the colors
that are closer to that place.
So I'm not gonna pick the darker shade
here because this gradient actually
goes from the left to the right.
So where it meets the second
tab, it's actually lighter.
So for it to connect better visually,
I'm gonna pick the lighter color.
Okay.
Adding some text to it, and I'm
gonna call it option one.
And now make sure that it's,
of course, in the center.
So I'm just gonna use our tried
and true techniques with the squares.
And, yeah, it's good enough.
Of course, you can see that the bottom
edge is a little bit further apart,
but you can't really do much about it.
So what you could try is to try
and align it a little bit better with,
like, decimal points, but I don't
think that's gonna be a good idea.
So if it doesn't match by just
a fraction of a pixel, then it's fine.
So in this case, it's gonna be okay.
And now, of course, duplicate that
text, the option one, text, and then
just simply move it to the second tab.
And of course, it's gonna be
invisible because it's a white
text on a white background.
So I'm gonna pick the darker
shade of blue here
and simply rename it to option two.
And if you want, you can
tweak the color of this
font a little bit as well.
Make sure that it's aligned
horizontally and vertically
in the center, because this is
for tabs especially
important, just as for buttons.
And what's also good is to not
just leave it as the outline,
but also add that white background
to it as well as a fill.
That's because when it has a fill, it's
actually sometimes easier to click
on it because it's a fuller shape.
And, yeah, you can play around
with the font color
a Little bit, if you want.
And the tabbed group like this
on iOS is called segmented Control.
And if you want, you can also
create one with three elements.
Then just make sure that the middle
element has all their corners sharp.
Okay, let's do a couple
of more classic tabs this time.
So I'm just gonna create
a background, because these tabs work
best if they have, like
a fuller background behind them.
So I'm gonna make a rectangle.
It's gonna be pretty tall, 60 points.
And I'm gonna change the color
to white and start it off with a.
And as usual, I'll start
with the shadow colors.
I'm going to pick the shadow color
from the shadow color of our
buttons and then simply decrease
the opacity and also decrease
the brightness a little bit.
Just a tiny bit here.
And I'm going to increase the blur
to 32 and then y value to 16.
So this whole area is
a little bit more visible.
But if you want it to blend in more,
you can also decrease the opacity.
So this could be like a top
navigation bar of our app.
And I'm gonna copy and paste the text
onto it, and then I'm
simply gonna rename it to option
one, duplicate it, and rename
the other one to option two.
And.
Yeah, you guessed it.
Using the rectangle tool, I'm,
gonna create a little underline
under the selected option.
You can either place it at the very
bottom or you can even leave a little
gap, like a one pixel gap like this.
But I'm gonna place it
at the bottom and I'm gonna choose
the height, the of, of four.
And of course, if there are two tabs,
this whole area, this whole nav bar
or navigation bar, needs to be split
exactly in two by that underline.
This is because the text
on it, the length of the text can
be different for each tab.
So it's still best to have
one element uniform.
And since my navbar is 300 points, then
this line is gonna be 150.
And of course, as usual, I'm
gonna copy the properties
of the tab above and then paste them
onto this little line.
And of course, select the line
and then make sure that
the font itself is aligned
to the center of the line as well.
So the line is exactly in the center.
But then what you can do is
to duplicate it, move it to the second
option, and align the second option
and then instead of removing it, just
decrease the opacity down to zero.
That way you'll always
have that invisible line.
So if you actually duplicate this
entire screen or this entire object.
It will be pretty easy for you to bring
back that line under the second option
and then hide the one under the first.
So it will be a lot easier for you
to create variants of this.
What you can also do is play around
with the font weight and color,
because the current option,
the selected one, can also be made
more visible and more prominent.
Just make sure that the second
option is still pretty visible
and still has pretty good
contrast to the background.
It can't be looking like
it's turned off.
And I'm gonna add one more effect
to it that's completely optional.
So I'm just gonna draw a rectangle
the size of our line
and position it under the text.
So on the layer, let's just bring
it down and I'm gonna pick
a blue color from the line to it
and change it to a gradient.
Now, in the gradient editing
mode, grab the handles, those
little circles at the end,
and Simply rotate it 180 degrees.
So the difference is that it has
the same color on each side,
but one of those sides has 100%
opacity and the other has 0%.
So it kind of fades to nothing.
And I'm gonna decrease the opacity
to a much smaller value.
So I'm gonna go with 15%.
So it goes from 15% to zero.
And as you can see, it gives that
little glow from under the line
that kind of complements the tab.
And just one quick little change.
I'm gonna duplicate one of my
checkboxes again and I'm gonna
remove all the styling from it
and I'm gonna actually change it
to a solid color color.
Because if you're having very gradient
heavy and shadow heavy buttons,
you can also go for that contrasting,
minimal look of that last checkbox.
Just please make sure your
checkboxes don't have shadows.
Okay.
There's only one element missing
from the very useful basic elements,
and that is the radio button.
So I'm gonna copy that first not
selected checkbox and I'm gonna rename
the label to say, option one.
And what you can do instead
of creating a circle is to actually
increase the border radius of it
to actually turn it into a circle.
I'm gonna move it up a little
bit and then duplicate it.
And of course, the other one is
gonna be called option two.
Now what we want to do is
to create the on state.
So I'm gonna do it for option one here.
So what I do here is to duplicate
that shape that we have here.
The circle and then simply make
it smaller proportionally.
And I want to have it
in the eight point grid.
So I'm gonna decrease the size a tiny
bit more so it's actually eight points
from every side just like this.
Okay.
I wonder what the next step could be.
Well, obviously what I need to do is
to select one of the objects with
the right gradient and then copy the
properties and then zoom into our
new circle and then paste the
properties.
That way we'll have the same gradient
and the same effect that we have
on all the other items of the form.
And what you can also do is copy
and paste the styles or the properties
of the font form the tabs,
because this can actually show much
better that an option is selected.
Just if you do that, make sure that
you do it for the checkboxes as well.
Okay, let's do one last thing
before we wrap up for today.
So what I'm gonna do is create a graph.
And many people actually use those
rounded lines for this, but what
I'm gonna use is sharp ones
because most graphs don't really have
those sinusoid rounded edges.
So most graphs look like this,
this, and this is what you
should be actually sticking to.
So if it's blue, it works.
It makes sense.
It matches our shape.
But it's always best to have
those graphs to be a little bit
thicker than your standard line.
So I'm gonna go with five.
But then here is the trick
to actually make it look cool.
I'm gonna duplicate that selection
and I'm gonna use the pen
tool to actually add to it.
So what I'm gonna do is to create
a shape to kind of finish this shape.
And, and since it's not a line
anymore, it's more of a filled shape.
I'm gonna turn off the stroke
and change it to a fill.
And what we're gonna do here is
to select the blue
color that we already have.
It can be a lighter blue like
this, it doesn't matter.
And then change the gradient to linear.
And just make sure that the whole
opacity decreasing part is actually
below the edge, the bottom edge of
that new shape that we just created.
And also that you move it below
the line that we first created.
And if you decrease the opacity just a
little bit, you have a very nice
looking graph that actually has some
additional effect to it that makes it
stand out and look a little bit less
boring.
And if you have more than one line
on the graph as well, you
can actually create the second one
in a different color.
And add a different gradient
to it, but use it the same way and it
can blend in a pretty nice way.
So this is going to be our high
fidelity starting point point just
to explore all the potential
objects and whenever you can, try
to actually build your own versions
of them and try to experiment with
the additional effects or filters
or whatever you can add to make it
more interesting.
Sometimes it's an icon, sometimes
it's emojis, sometimes it's
an extra shape of some kind.
But whatever you do, just make
sure that all of your main
objects, your main UI elements,
are completely accessible.
Because if they're not, then it's going
to be a very bad user experience.
So you can experiment with
the decoration as we established
previously, but don't go over the top
too much with the actual components
that are necessary for the user
to complete their task.
See you in the next part of the course
where we'll be starting to work
on some of the actual screen design.
Okay.
After some initial playground
exercises, now it's time to work on
the actual screen designs of our app.
App.
And it's going to be a continuation
of the app that we created
in the first course.
The first thing that I want to do is
to rename the pages that we already
have in the file and then create
a new page for those screens.
And I'm going to call it Screens.
And once we have that done,
let's create the first frame.
And since Figma doesn't have the iPhone
12 and this is what I want to use,
I'm going to manually enter the right
values, which is 390 by 844.
And we're gonna recreate one
of the original login screens from
the first course, but this time
in a little bit higher fidelity.
So I'm gonna start with
creating the form fields.
And of course, the first step
is creating a rectangle.
We use the 32 point distance
margin from every side.
So I'm gonna keep that and I'm
gonna make my form field stay at 50
and I'm gonna round the corners
to four points as well.
Now what we need to do
is change the color to white
and add a stroke to it.
And for that stroke, I'm gonna
pick a color that matches the green
that we used in the app.
So I'm gonna go with a little bit
of a light brown hue.
Generally you can have pretty
strong and thick borders, and of
course they're gonna make it
a little bit more accessible.
But if you want that modern style
and if you keep the background
of this form field at white.
This should work for
most people as well.
And of course you can add
a typical drop shadow to it, but we're
not gonna go with that.
Instead we're gonna try an inner
shadow to give this sort of depth
of showing that you can actually
add something to this field.
But I'm gonna modify it slightly.
So the first thing that I'm
doing is reversing the shadow.
So I want it to actually
happen from the bottom.
This will give us a,
nice bottom edge for the text
inside the field to show on.
And then I'm gonna use the color
picker to pick the border color
for the shadow and then greatly
decrease the opacity of it.
You probably notice that most of
the high fidelity design is about very
subtle effects and subtle objects.
So we don't really want
a super strong shadow here.
And I'm gonna play around
with the blur a little bit.
And obviously you can keep your
borders and your inner fields
completely normal, so you don't really
need to use that inner shadow.
This is just something to make
it a little bit different.
So I'm going to modify a couple
of values until this field
starts to stand out a little bit.
Just make sure that if you've added
already an inner shadow to this, avoid
adding a drop shadow or an external
shadow as well, because that will
make the bottom edge look blurry.
And I'm going to add a placeholder
text that says enter your email.
And of course, let's place it
in the center, but we'll align it
it a little bit more closely now.
So I'm going to start
by creating a rectangle with
16 points on each side.
And I'm going to align the text
optically to that square.
Now I'm going to choose a medium
italic because most placeholders are
actually a little bit leaning.
And I'm going to change the color
of the text to our border color.
If your color is light, like in my
case, you can decrease the saturation
and the brightness a little bit.
So I'm just going to tweak
it just a tiny bit.
But we want that text to be
lighter but still visible.
Many designers, while making high
fidelity designs for websites like
Dribbble, go with very small fonts.
But we're not gonna do that because we
want our high fidelity designs to
actually be accessible and work well.
So I'm gonna change the font size
to 14, and then I'm gonna use
two squares to align it perfectly
in the vertical center.
Just make sure that you use those
squares to align Align the text
optically to the capital letter.
Now let's duplicate that text
and create the label, above the field.
And I'm just gonna
add your email to it.
And of course this has to be
darker, so I'm gonna go into
the brightness and decrease it
by a couple of tens of points.
Generally go for brightness of below 40
and you should be fine.
And you can increase or decrease
the saturation a little bit.
And of course this text doesn't have
have to be italic, so I'm gonna just
change it to a little bit bolder font.
And let's pick an eight point square
to set the distance between
the label and the form field.
So I'm just gonna move
it one point down.
Okay, now we have our form field and
we can remove the helper square and
then select everything and then,
group it and rename that group to
something that will help us to
identify it later.
So I'm not gonna be too original here.
And I'm just gonna name the group
group form field.
And to save time in many of these
exercises, in this part of the course,
I'm not gonna be naming all my
groups, but of course you should.
And now let's duplicate this
group and rename it to password.
And I'm also gonna increase the size
of those label text fields so
they match the size or the width
of the actual form fields.
That way you can add longer
text to them and not be
afraid that it's gonna break.
And of course, I need
to also change the placeholder text
to enter your password.
Okay, this is going
to be our login screen.
So the last two things that we
need is a forgot your password
button and the actual login
button, and of course a registration
button if we're at it.
So I'm going to duplicate one
of the form fields and I'm going
to remove the placeholder
and place the label inside.
I'm going to right align the text so
it's on the right side of our field.
And then simply remove all the effects
and all the shadows and borders
from the form field and just change
the text to say forgot your password.
That way this text will be
the exact right distance from those
form fields to be easy to tap.
And this is what we're aiming for here.
Okay, time to add some buttons.
So I'm going to switch to our
components page and I'm going to
pick one of the rounded buttons that
we had created before and then I'm
going to copy it and paste it onto
this screen.
But obviously we need to make
the button a little bit wider.
So I'm gonna align it
to the right side.
That way I don't have to move
the circle and the chevron and then
simply click into the shape and modify
the width of the orange rectangle.
And, yeah, there we have it.
But of course, our app was
green before, so we're not
gonna go with orange here.
And the good approach is
to actually use the main color that
you had as the accent color.
So our green would be reserved
to the most important actions,
and we're gonna play around
with a much darker hue.
So for the fill of our button, I
picked the color of the border
of our form fields, and I'm
gonna decrease the brightness
and saturation a little bit, and
the brightness actually a little
bit more.
So the brightness should be
like a very dark, almost
black version of the color.
But of course, we don't want to have
text that has an orange shadow
under it on a button of this color.
So I'm gonna remove
the shadow completely.
And for our circle here, I'm
gonna pick the shadow color because
we do want the shadow there.
And I'm gonna pick the same color
as the bottom, just decrease
the brightness just a tiny bit.
So by 10.
So, as you can see, when I zoom
in, that shadow is visible,
but it's kind of barely visible.
Okay, let's start with changing
the Create account text to say
login, because after all, this
is a login screen, and I'm gonna
horizontally auto align it.
So I'm gonna select the text
and the bottom button behind
it, and I'm gonna click the icon
on the top right,
and the text is now in the center.
And it was already in the center
vertically as well as
horizontally before, so we
should be fine on both axis.
Now let's go into the button and let's
modify the color of the shadow,
because we can't have an orange
shadow under a brown button.
So the first thing I'm doing
is that I'm decreasing
the saturation and then decreasing
the brightness a little bit.
The opacity of the Shadow
here is 30%, which is good.
But I'm gonna play around
with some values again.
So a, and blur value and then
a little bit of a spread so this
shadow can actually look a little
bit more organic and natural.
Okay.
I'm going to leave the values
at that, but I'm going to decrease
the brightness just a tiny
bit more so that shadow is still
a little bit more visible.
And we can do even more blur and even
more negative Spread if we want to.
It's all about playing around
with what feels right.
And remember, once again, those objects
need to be very subtle so the shadows
don't have to be too strong.
It's all about just adding a little bit
of perceived depth to the object,
not like a very strong shadow that
will take over the entire design.
Okay, now let's duplicate the button
and create a registration button.
Since login is the primary action here,
always remember to never have those
two buttons look exactly the same.
Login has to be the stronger button
of the.
So I'm going to use the trick that
we've done on the element and
components page, and I'm going to
pick, using the color picker, just
that shadow color where the shadow
under the login button starts for the
registration button.
And of course, in this case, the shadow
under that circle is way too strong,
so we can just completely remove it
because we don't want the second
button to attract too much attention.
And of course, we can just
rename it to register
and then align it to the center.
Now, for the text color, I'm just
gonna use the color picker and pick
the color from the primary button.
Because the color of the secondary
button comes from the primary one or
from its shadow, having this
consistent is gonna look good.
Avoid using pure black for the color of
the second button because it will make
it stand out a little bit too much.
Okay, now I'm gonna select both
the form fields and the login button
and I'm gonna duplicate them.
And the next step is is to duplicate
the forgot your password text and then
move it under the login button.
So I'm gonna do that now and I'm
gonna rename that group so it's
gonna be easier for me to find.
So, okay, let's duplicate it
and then move it under
the login button, but just right
above the registration one.
And if you need to align it properly,
you can zoom in a little bit
and then just see if those elements
are stacked on top of each other.
Now let's change the text here
to don't have an account and then
center it inside the field.
This is a slightly faster version
of what we did in the first course.
This extra label acts as
an introduction to the main button,
but doesn't have to be bold.
So I'm gonna change it to medium.
And while we're there, we can
also change the forgot your
password text to medium as well.
That's because these elements are
not essential for the screen.
They are important if you need that
option but for most people, the most
important button is gonna be the
login, and the most important,
important fields is gonna be the email
and password ones.
And if you're using the OS helpers,
you know that there is this
little line that you drag to go
to the home screen again.
So I'm moving everything
up a little bit, and then I'm aligning
The login button 24 points
to that invisible square around
the don't have an account text.
Okay.
We always start with
the functional elements, so
the elements that are necessary.
Now we can add some visuals
to make it look more interesting.
So I'm creating an oval and placing it
on the top, top side of the screen.
And you might need to paste it
onto the screen if it shows
up the way that it did for me.
So the effect here is like a little
ellipse from the top of the screen
that's kind of reaching almost
our form fields, but it has to be
away enough so it's still visible.
And then for the color of it,
I'm gonna pick the color
from the registration button.
But of course, once you select
it, you can always make
it a little bit brighter.
So this is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna increase.
Increase the brightness
by just a couple points.
We don't want it to be too white,
because then it will just be invisible
on the white background.
But we want to have this subtle
transition between the colors.
And before we start adding some
additional visuals to these screens,
let's duplicate one of them and create
a version of it, because we
want as many versions as possible.
So this version is not gonna have
that little circle on the registration
button, but instead it's gonna
have a little bit more text on it.
So I'm just gonna add.
Don't have an account
question mark, and then register.
So we have this entire message
from the label,
above the button on the button.
Now, that means that we don't
really need that label anymore.
And of course, that button
text has to be smaller, too.
So I'm gonna select
the label and remove it.
And let's click into the text again.
And what we want here is
to change the width of the text to be
focused on the word register.
So the don't have an account is
basically like an intro to it.
And I'm gonna decrease the font
size a little bit as well.
What we want is to have enough
space on the left and the right
side for clear readability.
And to set it up for possible longer
text, I'm gonna create two squares
that are 24 by 24, and place them
on both sides of the button.
So those squares will serve as our,
padding inside the button.
And I'm gonna resize the size, the text
to match them on both sides.
When this is done, we just center
the text field and it's
in the center of the button again.
And then we can remove those helper
squares and we have ourselves a button
with some additional text on it.
Of course, we need to be sure that
that text is vertically
in the center of the button as well.
So I'm just gonna create two squares
on the top and the bottom, and then
I'm gonna move the text up.
And as in this case, if there is just
a little bit of a difference, you can
leave it at that, because you can't
really code it in decimal points.
But if it is a portfolio project,
you can actually enter a decimal
point to the Y value and play
around with this a little bit.
So in my case, it's going
to be probably 784.3.
And in this case, this is perfectly
in the center on how the font renders.
And this is going to be really
good for a portfolio project.
But in real apps that are going to be
coded, don't use decimal point points.
This can be really good
for presentation.
And now we can bring the buttons
a little bit closer together.
Of course, they need some space
between them, so that can be 40,
for example, or 32, or even 24.
Avoid having lower space than
that because that can lead to two
buttons being too close to one
another to be easy to touch.
So I'm just gonna go with 24 here.
And also, if one of the buttons has
a shadow, and that shadow can overlap
the button below, we have to modify
the values a little bit so it doesn't.
We don't really want the shadow
to be cast onto the second button.
So I'm just making it
a little bit smaller here.
Okay, but this second option
doesn't need that much
space on the bottom here.
So I'm just gonna select the entire
form and then I'm gonna move it down.
I want this, bottom register button
to align with the bottom button
on the other screen, basically.
So it's gonna be about 4:40
points from the bottom
of the entire iPhone screen.
And now we can take our ellipse that
we've created before and move it down.
That way we have more space
for some visual later on.
And then we can change that fill
to a, linear gradient.
And in the standard option, it
just creates a, zero percent
opacity on one of the sides.
So if you have a light color like the
one that we have here and the white
background, you can come up with a
couple of very interesting angles
where the gradient, gradient can
disappear on one of the sides or the
other.
And this can lead to some
very nice visual effects.
And I'm gonna say it again
because I want it to be clear
with high fidelity.
It's all about the very subtle
decoration with the background
and the non important UI elements,
because all the important UI
elements need to be accessible.
And I know you're probably eager for
us to start adding some juicy, nice
visuals to it, but let's wait a
while still, because we still need
to create a registration screen for
the app.
So for that, I'm gonna duplicate one
of the login screens and then
modify some of the form fields.
But let's start from the top part.
So I'm gonna copy the text that
says register because it's already
in the dark color that we want.
And I'm gonna rename it
to create a free account.
That text is gonna give us a visual
anchor on the top of the page.
Now let's switch the element ellipse
to the linear gradient that we
had before, and then we can stretch
it down a little bit as well.
That way we'll have a fading
gradient from the top
of the screen towards the bottom.
And of course, that
text has to be bigger.
So I'm gonna pick the font 32.
Once we have that larger font
title, let's align it
on the left edge to 32 points.
And to do that, I'm gonna create
a square that's 32 by 32
and then optically align that very
first first letter to it.
And it seems to be almost perfect.
So I'm just gonna move it by one
point, and if there is this fraction
of a point distance between
them, that is gonna be fine.
Okay.
The next step we can do is
to paste an external icon
to supplement our text.
And I already had an icon that works
with my organic shops, because this is
gonna be just a leaf icon and I want
to keep it the same color as the text.
Of course, if you're making a different
kind of icon, there might still be
an icon that will work well with it.
You can use the mini surfboard for
a surf shop, or like a bike wheel for
a bike shop, anything that just works.
And then let's use the chevron
that we already had and just
make it a little bit bigger.
Just make sure that the proportions are
gonna Stay and a little bit thicker,
and that's gonna be our back arrow.
So I'm just gonna place it above
this, and then I'm gonna copy
the register text again with the font
size that's already there.
And I'm gonna keep it
at register because this is actually
the title of this screen.
But this text is a little
bit too big, so I'm gonna
decrease the font size to 16.
Now we need to align it
properly to that chevron.
And this is not going to be super easy,
because, as you can see, it's not
exactly in the center in either way.
If you don't want to use rulers
but want to do quick alignments, you
can create a rectangle and then simply
decrease the opacity of it to 50%.
And that way, if you go through
the tip of the arrow of the chevron,
you can then align the middle
of the capital R to it.
That way it's going to be
vertically in the center.
Now, if you've done the first course,
you know that all the clickable
elements should be at least 44 by 44.
So I'm going to create a square
that's 44 by 44, and then I'm going
to put the chevron or the arrow
exactly in the center of it.
But first we need to move the arrow to.
To start at 32 points.
Okay, this is starting
to look pretty good.
I'm going to select the background
invisible square, and then
I'm going to move it again
to the center of our icon.
And then I'm going to align
the register icon to the right
side of that square.
And then, of course, we can
make it invisible again
by increasing the opacity to zero.
Okay, we have a lot of the header space
done, so we can actually bring this
entire form a little bit further up.
So first I'm gonna lock
the background, because I don't need
to select it every time.
And then I'm gonna move the form fields
higher, and of course, make sure
that your form fields are higher than
the background on the layer list.
In my case, they weren't, so
I'm just gonna move the background
a little bit lower.
And if you have a lot
of groups, you might have to close
them all up like this.
And then just drag the ellipse
from the background down.
It can be the very last layer
on the list because it is
after all, the background.
And then I'm gonna duplicate
the password field and of course,
rename it to repeat your password.
And also, we don't need
a forgot Your password link
on a registration screen.
So I'm just gonna select
that and remove it.
Then I'm gonna remove the secondary
button with the labels, and I'm
gonna change the primary button
to say register and make sure
that if you add the new text,
you centered it horizontally.
Now let's bring it closer
to the form fields, and you can
keep it at 30 or 40 or 48.
Okay, the registration screen is done,
so we can start adding some colors
on some extra visual materials to it.
Let's start by changing the fill
color of our icon here
to something a little bit more green.
And of course, if you have that
brown text, dark brown text, you
can use a, lighter green to actually
spice it up a little bit.
Kind of like this.
If you're going with the secondary
color, make sure that it's about
in the same quadrant as
the one that I picked because
it cannot be too bright.
And then I'm going to copy the hex
color and paste it onto our button.
And that way we have a little bit
more color while still keeping
the primary color as that brown
or light brown for our form field
borders and other things.
And of course, you can also then copy
the HSB values to the button itself.
So I'm just going to change
the shadow color of that little
circle, the right side.
And of course, it cannot be too
dark, as you can see, so I'm just
gonna keep it 10 points below what
it was, just barely visible.
And I'm using those fully
rounded buttons here.
But of course, you can use
the slightly less rounded or
even completely sharp ones.
It all depends on the theme
and the style of your app.
I'm also changing the hue of our
little chevron arrow on the button
to match the new green,
and also changing the shadow color
to a green hue hue as well.
It's gonna be barely visible,
but it does make some
subconscious difference.
So definitely always change
all the colors too much.
And if you want to be precise, you
can copy the hue value from the color
and then paste it into the shadow.
And then you can increase
the brightness and the saturation a,
tiny bit if you want to have
that color feel of the shadow.
So if our button is green and we
want a more green shadow,
it can be visible as green.
Just don't go too much overboard.
And I'm gonna decrease the blur
and decrease the spread here as well.
So shadow is a little bit more visible.
And one of the main rules of high
fidelity design is that if you're
adding a shadow to a button, try
to have the button itself be
either solid color or a very
subtle gradient.
If your shape has already enough
effects on it, adding a shadow
is just gonna complicate things.
Okay, time to paste in some visuals
from the outside and I have them
prepared in advance to match
the style of my organic shops app.
So as you can see, I have
a leaf here that casts a nice
green shadow under it.
I have a green apple that
doesn't have a shadow.
And also I have a blurred leaf.
The same leaf, but blurred and rotated.
So what you can do here, of course
you can cut out some images, some PNGs
from the background.
You can use some Internet
tools that can relate remove
the background automatically.
Or you can just use a,
path tracing tool yourself to do it.
So if you have a blurred item, it
adds the depth, so it kind
of creates that bokeh effect that
makes all those elements look a little
bit more three dimensional.
And when the blur is turned off
for that one element, it makes this
whole screen look a lot more boring.
Okay, that apple needs a shadow.
So I'm gonna duplicate the apple
and I'm gonna name
the layer Apple just to be sure.
And then I'm gonna blur
one of the layers.
So one of the layer is the actual
apple without the blur,
and the other one below on the layer
list is the blurred one.
And then you can decrease the size
a little bit and decrease the opacity
and then move it under the apple.
That way the blur will actually have
the right colors in the right spots
coming from the actual apple image.
If your app doesn't have simple
shapes like that that you could use
as visuals, you can also use icons
or just simple geometric shapes.
We will talk more about decoration like
this in an entire chapter dedicated
to decorations, which is gonna be
chapter 11 of this part of the course.
So for now I'm just pasting in some
images, but in that chapter I'm
gonna show you all the techniques
of cutting them out from the
background, picking the right ones,
rotating them the right way, and
everything else.
Because decoration is so essential
to very nice looking and pretty
unique, high fidelity designs, I think
it deserves a chapter of its own.
Now, for the login screen, I also
prepared a couple of objects
that I'm gonna paste in now.
And as you can see, we have an organic
Shops bag with the Organic Shops
logo that's using the same leaf
that we actually pasted in before.
And then we have a couple of blurred
leaves on every side of it
and a couple of different shapes.
So we have the apple
and we have some peppers.
And of course, one of the those
things is also a blurred carrot.
So I'm just trying to position
all the images
as if they're floating in space.
And of course, the shadow under
the leaf is just the duplicate
of that leaf, just with a layer blur.
So it's pretty easy to create
additional shadows for the objects
the way that we did before.
Just add a drop shadow.
You can also pick the color
right from the object.
Just pick a darker shade and then
decrease the opacity to to below 50%.
And then you can play around
with the blur values and the Y
values so it looks good.
Today, you can try to play around
with a couple of shapes like
this that match the style and theme
of your app on your own.
But of course, in chapter 11
of this course, we will cover on how
to make them even better.
And I'm gonna show you one more thing.
I'm gonna duplicate the registration
screen, and let's change the button
that we have there for the brown
button, the dark brown one.
Because if we have a green button and
there is a lot of green objects that
are decoration, the button can be a
little bit less visible, actually, so
that darker button can stand out a lot
more.
I'm gonna change the text to register
and of course, use the auto align
to align it to the center.
And I'm gonna repeat it yet again.
The goal of high fidelity
design is not to go overboard.
So if we got a lot of visually
green objects next to our text, we
can also change that icon color
to the text color to match.
And as I said, we will cover this in
more detail in the decoration chapter.
But one thing that you need
to do if you're having some nice
shapes like this is to always
have some of them overlap.
That will create this nice depth
effect that we're after here.
And of course, that pepper
can have a shadow as well.
So I'm just gonna use a drop shadow.
And then using the color picker,
pick a darker orange hue from
the pepper itself, then decrease
the opacity and then increase
the blur and you have a nice looking
realistic shadow under it.
And of course, that shadow
can be modified even further.
So you can do anything that you want
with it as long as it's consistent
with all the other shadows.
So you can move it further away
from the object like this,
using the higher Y value,
and then blur it a little bit.
That will give the impression that
that pepper is floating higher
on the top above everything else.
So just play around.
But remember the main rule.
Everything has to Be subtle.
The carrot is just a carrot
with a layer blur, just to add
a little bit more variety
to those shapes and those colors.
Because nature, of course,
green is the main association
with nature or organic shops.
That is the theme of my app.
But you can have different
colors that are also matching like
oranges, yellow and browns.
And you can also add
some circles in white.
If you have a light background
like that in a couple
of spots around the object.
Just make sure that those circles
are also made by the objects
overlapping some of them and also
don't have too many of them.
If you want to add decoration
to the background like that,
two or three is more than enough.
And I usually place one
on the left side, one on the right
side, and a smaller one,
one somewhere near the top.
And of course the left and right one
need to be at different heights as
well because if they're on the same
distance or the same height from
each other on each side, then it's
not gonna look organic or natural,
but instead it's gonna look like
it's pre planned and we don't really
want that.
We want a natural look.
And just as with here, the carrot
is overlapping that circle.
So I'm gonna move the pepper
away a little bit so it creates,
creates a nice harmony
with all the other shapes.
And in some cases you can decrease or
increase the blur for some objects.
So in this case I can remove it
from the leaf or bring it back
depending on what you want.
So in this case I'm just gonna add
a shadow to that leaf and do the
same thing that we've done
before, so a little bit of blur
and then picking the green color
from it.
And it is a similar effect,
but that blurred object behind it
creates a more natural look
looking shadow than this one.
So try and experiment with a couple
of different background shapes
at different opacities and gradients
and play around with your objects.
Now let's duplicate one
of the login screens and let's create
a different version of it.
This time I'm gonna add some
social logins and create more
of a like a splash screen page.
So I'm gonna remove the form
fields from here and I'm
gonna move everything down.
That gives us a lot more room to play
around with with our shapes and with
our added graphics so they can be
arranged completely differently and
that gives us room to be even more
creative.
So I'm just rearranging some
of the objects here.
I really like the gradient that we had
on one of the other screens.
So I'm going to change
the background of the ellipse
to a linear gradient again.
And of course, I'm going
to rotate it just a little
bit so it's more visible.
This time, I'm going to leave some
of the color on the left side with
the right side flip fading into white.
And of course, to make the gradient
more interesting, it doesn't have
to be exactly from left to right.
You can use some diagonal
directions as well.
In some cases, having a splash screen
like that that is more visual can
be a nice way for people to get
the first look and feel of the app.
So first I'm gonna remove
the don't have an account label.
And then I'm gonna bring
the buttons a little bit higher.
And of course, there needs
to be some space between the buttons,
but I'm gonna keep it at,
like, a moderate distance.
For the second button, we're not
gonna need the circle and the chevron,
so I'm just gonna remove it.
And actually, let's remove it
for the first button too,
because this is just one way
of approaching the buttons,
but it's not the only right way.
Okay, let's keep the buttons
at 24 points apart.
And then let's add the third
button, which is gonna
be a, social media login.
So this is gonna be login with Twitter,
and that will use your Twitter account
to authenticate into the app right
away so you won't have to register.
And I'm gonna use a free library
of icons or an icon font called
Social ico and I'm gonna give
you a link to download it.
So Twitter is under the letter L
for some reason.
So I'm just gonna type in L and then
I'm gonna increase the font size to
have the Twitter bird match the size
of the font in the text.
Okay, now we need to change
the color of the button.
So I went to Twitter and took
a screenshot of one
of the tweet buttons that has
the right brand color on it.
And then I paste it in next
to my main artboard.
Now I select the Login with Twitter
button, and using the color picker, I
pick the color of the pasted button.
And now we can remove it because
it's not gonna be needed anymore.
Now let's change the shadow color
to that same color again.
So using the color picker, pick
the color from the button itself
and of course, decrease
the opacity down to 50%.
You can play around with the values
until the button color or the shadow
color is visible, but just make
sure that it has to be subtle.
And if you want it to be more visible,
you can decrease the blur, as
in my case, and decrease the spread.
So I'm gonna play around
with a couple of values until
the button looks right.
And of course, if you want to create
a Facebook login, you can use
the colors from the Facebook branding.
And if you want to create
the Instagram login, you can.
You can grab the gradient
from the Instagram logo.
It's available in many
online resources.
And those three buttons do a little bit
of the same thing, but the last one
actually is a combined version of
both the registration and the login.
So I'm gonna move it a little
bit away from the other buttons.
And now let's center
the bird on the button.
But first of all, let's create
a square, the height of this icon,
if the icon is sticking out
of it on the sides a little bit.
So just a couple
of pixels here and there.
This is gonna be fine.
So these objects here, don't really
matter as long as the bulk
of the icon fits within that square.
Now I'm gonna duplicate it, and as
you can see, we have the exact same
size of everything on every side.
So the distance from the bird to
the bottom of the button is the same
as the height of the bird
and also the distance from the top.
So the bird is actually
in the right spot Here.
You can use either 16 or 8 as
the spacing between the bird
icon and the login text.
So I'm just gonna use eight
here because I believe that
having them a little bit closer
together will work well.
And once it's all aligned, just group
the icon with the text and then select
the group and the rectangle behind
it, and then center it horizontally.
And this is starting
to look really good.
Of course, you can add a very
subtle drop shadow to the icon.
Just make sure that the shadow
is made from the color
of the background and then just
slightly decreased brightness.
And same goes for text, but with
text on buttons, if you want
to add shadow, just make sure that
the values are not that big.
So I usually go with a blur
of 2 and y equals 1.
That gives us that very subtle
shadow that just works really well.
And I can give that same shadow
to the icon, too, because the shadow
under this button is very subtle.
We can.
However, it's not really
necessary, but we can do it.
We can create a linear gradient
on the button.
Just pick the same color with
the same opacity on both sides.
And as usual, I'm going to go
with A diagonal gradient because
they look a lot more interesting.
And the rule is this, and I've
told you this before a couple times,
that the darker color should
always be nearer to the bottom.
So if we're using a diagonal
gradient, the bottom one needs
to be a little bit darker.
But the difference between
those colors and brightness
can be between 10 and 20.
So it doesn't have
to be a huge difference.
If you go too far, the gradient is
gonna look grotesque or unnatural.
And the best looking gradients
are the ones that barely
look like a gradient.
It's more of a feeling
of a gradient than, the actual
visual gradation of the colors.
And yeah, this button is starting
to look really good.
Now we need a way to visually separate
the standard login and registration
from the social media one.
So I'm gonna create a line
between them, but it's not
gonna be a typical separator.
So that line is gonna be a little
bit smaller than half width.
And then I'm gonna copy that, forget
your password, whole rectangle.
And then I'm gonna place
it between the buttons.
And the thing that we want to do
here is to also grab it and move it
to the bottom of the layer list.
So it's under our line,
that we just created.
And once you move it under
that line, it should have
the text on the right side.
Try to align it vertically so that line
goes through the middle of the text.
Text.
I'm gonna write the word or here
and I'm gonna center the text.
Now I'm gonna move the line a little
bit to the top so it's aligned
perfectly to the center of the text.
And then I'm gonna make it a little
bit wider so it's about eight
points between the line and the start
of the text on every side.
And for those lines, I'm gonna pick
the color that we already had
for lines, which is gonna be
the border color of our form fields.
And you're gonna use the same
color for the text as well?
Well, you can use the color
picker the same way.
If you feel that the text is
not visible enough,
then you can decrease the brightness
of the text a little bit.
But don't go too far.
And of course, you can just bring
it right next to the register
button and then bring the Twitter
button next to it, but it's gonna
be still a little bit too close.
So it's best to actually
move away all of it, 24 points
from the button previous to it.
And then you can actually grab
the social media button
and move it 24 points below.
That way you have enough
white space for those buttons
to be clearly separated.
Of course, if you're making an app
that's a lot more condensed, you
can use 16 instead of 24 here.
Okay, now let's play around
with some more colorful backgrounds,
because they can also exist
in high fidelity designs.
It doesn't have to be
so subtle every time.
So I'm just gonna duplicate
the screen with the green register
button, and then I'm gonna copy it,
and I'm gonna paste it
onto the top of that screen.
So it starts from the very top,
and you can actually stretch it
to go outside of the screen,
and then move it a little bit
down towards the form fields.
Then I'm gonna grab that layer,
and I'm gonna paste it near
the bottom of this entire layer list,
just above the ellipse
with the subtle gray gradient.
Now you can select the form field that
you already have, and you can position
it around 48 points from that object.
But first, you need to play around
with the alignment just right.
So I'm gonna select the entire form,
and I'm gonna place it at 48 points
away from our new colorful background.
And I told you this before,
but it's really good to have some
objects overlap one another.
And if you're going with more
colorful backgrounds like this,
those blurred objects might not be
the best idea, because they will
just look like a little bit of a
messy shape on, an otherwise green
background.
So I'm gonna remove all the blurred
shapes, and I'm gonna paste in
the yellow pepper and the carrot
from the other screen.
And the best way to align everything
is to kind of proportionally
distribute it in the free space.
And of course, I'm gonna remove
the blur and increase the opacity
of the carrot as well.
And if you already had a carrot
like this, you don't need
to exactly place it as it was before.
So I can rotate it a little bit.
So the right side of this screen,
which is more visual, more
graphic heavy, is gonna be
a little bit more interesting.
And then let's change the color
of the text to white
and of that chevron as well.
Okay, it's starting
to look a lot better now.
So once again, if you're using
blurred shapes, make sure they
look good on that background.
A shadow for this leaf here looks good
because it overlaps the background.
So the shadow under the pepper
also looks pretty good
because it gives some depth.
And I'm gonna change the background
color of this shape to a Gradient.
And once again, I'm gonna do
a diagonal gradient with a slightly
lighter variant of that color
on the top right and a slightly
darker one on the bottom left.
And once you already have a gradient
and you have all those shapes on top
of it, there is absolutely no need
for this object to have a shadow.
And also, if you have this icon
here, you can change the color
to something that will contrast with
the background a little bit better.
And for this object, in my case,
the carrot, I can duplicate that
image and pick the bottom one
on the layer list and simply blur it.
The rule is not to have too many
heavy visual objects like photos
on a header like this.
So three is gonna be more than enough.
Enough, especially since we
have a lot more text on it.
And you can play around with
the distance from the shadow to
the object as well to simulate how far
from the background they are.
For that background shape, I
picked the corner radius of 32
on purpose, because 32 is also
the distance from the sides.
So if I increase the corner radius,
you see that it doesn't really match
the distance from the form fields
and the button on the left and right.
So for consistency, it's actually
best to keep it the same.
But that, of course, isn't the only
option, because you can create a much
rounder object and then simply change
the position or orientation of it.
So you can create an option in which
the registration has, like a pill
shaped on the left side, starting
with the border of the screen and
then ending a little bit further on
the right.
Just make sure that the distance
from the right side is still the same.
32 points.
So in my case, I still need
to move it two points to the left.
And you can use this to your advantage
with some creative options here.
I'm gonna increase the corner
radius so it's a true pill shape.
And right now, since there is a little
bit more space to play around
with, I can redistribute my objects
and my shapes a little bit more.
And with the carrot, I have two images,
one blurred and one non blurred.
So I'm gonna group them and move
it a little bit outside.
Just make sure that not every
object is overlapping that shape.
And now you can decrease
the height of it.
So the distance from create a free
account to the bottom of our new shape
is similar to the distance from create
a free account to the word register.
Okay, now I hope you know
where this is going.
If we created a shape that cuts off
on the left side of the screen
and has a back arrow, we
can then Duplicate the login again
and copy that shape again.
Then I'm going to remove
the background that we had
on the very first first screen.
And then at the very bottom
of the layer list, I'm gonna paste
that shape again, but this time
move it to the other side.
So it starts at 32 points
on the left and ends on the right.
Just make sure that from
the left edge of the screen, it's
still the same 32 points.
So I'm just gonna align it.
Yeah, it now works well.
Now if you're using more heavy
visually shapes, like the pill
background that we have here, you
don't need that many objects anymore.
So remove most of them, Keep some of
them over, overlapping that new shape.
Just make sure that these shapes are
not completely taking the attention
away from the main object.
And also not all of them
should be overlapping.
So in my case, I'm just
gonna keep a couple of them.
But I'm gonna make enough space
to bring the shopping bag higher,
because the shopping bag has the logo
of the actual product here.
And to show the effect properly,
I'm gonna move the register
screen to the right side.
And as you see, can, can see if you go
to register from login, it can
naturally transition with that shape.
So that leaves you with a lot
of potential for very nice
animations in the product.
But even as flat mockups, those
two placed side by side will
look like they belong together.
Okay, let's bring that shopping
bag and the leaf overlapping
it a little bit higher.
Just make sure you select everything.
So whatever your logo is, just make
sure that it has enough breathing
room on the bottom to actually,
actually stick out a little bit,
because that's going to make it a lot
more interesting.
And then I'm going
to move the surrounding shapes
a little bit too.
Now what we want, if we're going
to switch between the screens,
we want the form fields to be
at exactly the same height.
So I'm just going to move
the login form fields and the entire
buttons, everything
from below a little bit higher.
And right now if you go between
those two buttons back and forth
using the back arrow from
register or using the register
from the the login screen, this
could be a very nice
transitioning animation.
But this is not the only way because
you can also rotate it, let's say 45
degrees, and you can play around with
different concepts of these shapes.
You can combine them with many
different ways so it doesn't
have to be a pill shape just
going from left to right.
It can be some more organic
shape that you can come up with.
But for your initial projects, you
usually try to start with rounded
rectangles of various roundness.
And if I paste that same shape again,
I can position it in a way
that actually it connects to that
very first screen one more time.
So with a rotation like that, it
has the natural progression,
but looks even more interesting.
And you can move around some objects
to match it even better.
We will play with decorations
and adding different shapes onto our
backgrounds more in the decorations of
chapter of this course.
But even in those very first
exercises, I wanted to show you a
couple of ways how you can make
your app being interesting without
sacrificing the accessibility,
readability, or the overall
expected app structure.
Because all the buttons and all
the form fields are here and are ready
to use, easy to use and readable.
All that we used to make these
screens more interesting are, some
external visuals that don't contribute
anything but the aesthetics.
And this is the main point
of high fidelity design.
We want our products to be
interesting, but we want them
to be accessible as well.
So we can add all of that interesting
uniqueness to them by using some
background shapes, some background
objects, and some simple images.
And those images can be icons, can be
fruit and veggies like in my case.
And depending on what your
app is about, it can be something
that matches that app.
And if your app is too abstract to
easily find images for it like
that, you can use simple shapes
like triangles, circles,
rectangles, some blurry ones,
some, standard ones, some ones
with gradients.
It's all up to you.
It doesn't have to be
objects based on photos.
You can also use images
of people this way and other things.
But we're gonna discuss it
in the decorations chapter
for now, I'm gonna repeat once
again the most important part
part about high fidelity design,
which is to be subtle.
So we don't want very strong shadows
and very strong gradients anywhere.
We want it all to be
very subtle and look very
natural, just like this one.
Okay, on to the next lesson.
See you there.
Okay, today, let's start with
a couple of concepts of what you
can do with the decorations.
First of all, don't be
afraid to be playful.
So an icon like that for
the shopping cart with a little smile
on it can be a very nice way
for that icon to stand out.
And because the main theme of our app
is green, like in the notification up
the top, the other color here is
brown, because brown matches green
very well, I'm gonna prove it to you
by just creating Those two colors
side by side.
So picking that dark brown next
to the green from the notification.
So to have your app look more
stylish, avoid having the main
primary vibrant color.
In our case the green be everywhere.
It just needs to be
in the most important elements like
the CTAs or the accents.
But if there are many different buttons
to add an item to card, they can be a,
different color, more muted or darker.
In this case, for the list
items, I went with both
the shadow and the border
to make it more accessible.
But see what happens if you turn
the stroke or the border off.
Of course, this card still works
even without it, even though it's
not fully accessible as the card.
But it's going to be easy to use anyway
because the structure of the cards
and the spacing between them
still shows you the right hierarchy
and the right layout and grid here.
So if you prefer, you don't need
to add the borders, you
can add subtle shadows like
the ones that we have here.
These are very similar shadows
to the ones that we used
in the login and registration.
Very soft and coming
from the main color.
And if you decide to cut out your
products, you can create nice,
realistic looking shadows under
them by just creating an oval and,
and adding a blur to it.
And of course, you can tweak it
even further by changing the color
of that shadow to the color coming
from the actual object.
So in this case, let's select it again
and I'm gonna go to the fill color
and use the color picker to pick from
our banana a little bit darker yellow.
But you can of course use standard
shadows under these objects as well.
It's just that with ellipses that
are blurred, you can have a little
bit more fun playing around with it.
So for the avocados, I'm gonna
pick one of the darker hues
of green here, and then we can
tweak it a little bit more.
So we can decrease the brightness or
reduce the saturation until it's not
fully green, but it's still visible
that it's coming from that object.
And same with the pepper, we can do
the exact same thing here, or we
can just duplicate it and blur it.
And of course, you can also
modify the object itself,
rotate it, and so on.
So starting with the very boring gray
shadows, we can add a little bit
of color to them to make this entire
screen pop a little bit more.
Just remember that that color needs
to be desaturated and dark enough so
it still looks like a shadow and not
like a, Colorful glow, because that
glow won't make sense visually.
And of course, you can always
decrease the opacity as well.
Just something to match it
to make it look more natural.
For the buttons, I chose a solid color,
the dark brown that we picked before.
But of course you can change it
into a gradient very easily.
Just pick that color, change it into
a linear gradient, and then change
both colors to be at, full opacity.
So 100%.
And I hope you remember the rule
for good looking gradients.
You simply add the same color
on both ends and then simply
modify the brightness just
a tiny bit by 10 or 20 points.
And using that combined with
a little bit of saturation tweaking,
maybe around 10 points,
it creates a gradient that looks
natural and is not over the top.
And for the top background in our
categories, we're using the exact
same object and photo with a little
bit of a dark gradient on the
bottom to make it more visible,
just like we did in the first part
of the course.
Okay, so that was a list view.
Now let's drag in a card view.
And for the border here, we're
using that same color that we used
for the form fields before.
So remember that this color needs
to be in the top left
corner of the color palette.
It needs to be pretty light.
But if you want to make a blue app,
for example, you can just move
the hue like this, and that
way you'll end up with a color that
still matches everything.
And of course, you can turn off
the shadow or you can create
an inner shadow for the object.
Just make sure that you
don't use too many effects.
So in this case, if we have
the inner shadow and the border,
if we add a drop shadow as well
and turn off the border, this card
is gonna look blurry and messy.
So many of these objects, they
might be feeling a little bit
like Neomorphism or a little bit
like an interesting approach.
In most cases, this is
just not going to work.
But, an object like this with an inner
shadow can work on a lighter
background that's actually consisting
of a little bit of that color.
So if your background is not white,
but instead like light yellow,
you can use an inner shadow like
that and try to make it work.
And of course, to match
the border radius of the cards,
I'm gonna decrease the ones
on the buttons here as well.
We want the diagonal distance between
the bottom corner and the corner
of the card to be equal
to the distance from the bottom
and the left and the right sides.
On larger cards, you can create
fully rounded Pill buttons.
And they should be able to work with
cards with sharper corners as well.
But it takes a little bit longer
to process for our brains.
So it's best to actually match
the buttons to the cards.
If you're going to make your products
into fully visible rectangular photos,
then this tip is not gonna be for you.
But if you want them to be cut out
from the background, like
this one, I'm gonna show you a tip
on how to actually
pick the right size for those photos.
So I'm gonna create three
distinct sections of the card.
The one for the button, the one for
the text, and the one for the photo.
And I'm gonna give each
of them a padding of, the standard
padding inside the card
on the sides of the button.
So if I decrease that padding one
more time on the left and the
right so the image doesn't get
outside the bounds of the button,
you can see how big the image can
be.
And if the image is more square,
just pick a square inside
with the right proportions.
So don't make your images or photos
too big or too small and use this rule
to pick the right size for them so
they don't overtake the card visually.
The image itself is of course, a very
important element of the card,
but it cannot be too big, because
if it's too big, then it's just
gonna break this entire layout.
And now let's look at a slightly
different version of this.
For this version, we're using pill
shaped buttons for the main filters
of the product and of the categories.
And then for the categories we're
using simple lists with images in
the background and a gradient
coming from fully black into a
black with 0% transparency and
simply coming from the left to
the right.
And of course, we have that 32
point margin on the left side
and the right side of the app.
So the internal margin for both
our chevron on the right side
and the label on each card is
gonna be exactly the same.
That will make those images actually
pop a little bit more with the labels.
But the general principle
is the same as with the login
and the registration.
You just add a little bit more
decoration, a little bit more
interesting approaches.
So for example, those backgrounds
with that gradient covering them
up on the left side so the text
is readable and you don't need
to go crazy with decoration.
Actually, in this case, I believe
the shadow under those cards
is a little bit too much.
So it probably will be looking
better without that shadow.
So don't go with all the gradients.
And all the shadows and all
the inner shadows and glows
and everything else on one object.
Because it's just gonna be
looking messy.
We don't want the messy look.
We want the high fidelity look that
also looks classy and minimal.
And of course, if you want, you
can also try creating a card view
with that same look with
a gradient and with a full background
photo of our products.
So this short video is more of an
overview of what you can do with
the existing colors that we picked
before for the product and what you
can do with simple objects, photos
and shadows to make your cards and
lists look a little bit more
interesting.
But of course, it's all about tweaking.
So if you pick a shadow that
you don't particularly like,
you can always modify it.
You can pick the color from the banana,
then you can simply zoom
in a little bit and then rotate
that object a little bit.
You can modify the transparency
of the shadow.
So just play around and find
an option that looks right.
And if that option doesn't look right
for some reason, you can decrease
the blur, increase the blur, move
the object a little bit away from it.
You can even make that whole
object bigger and you can make
it overlap the card from
the top a little bit like this.
With objects that are cut out
from the background, this can be
a good idea for the cards to actually
stand out a little bit as well.
Of course, this probably is a better
idea suited for some stores that have
a select and the same list of products
so they can prepare them in advance.
Because I don't think that everybody
will be cutting out all their
bananas and avocados every time.
And once you have the object
in place, don't settle
for the very first iteration.
You can always rotate it a little
bit, see how it will look in terms
of how it overlaps the card.
Because it's all about
experimentation and playing around.
And if you figure out an option that
you particularly like, then you can do
it to all the other cards as well.
When you're building your very first
portfolio of those initial projects
and you want to attract recruiters
and other companies to be interested
in what you do, having those cutout
images can actually be a very good
idea.
That's because that also shows
that next to all that vector
graphics and moving and creating
rectangles and ovals, you
also have some pixel skills.
And of course you can build
a beautiful app without
using any bitmaps whatsoever.
But if you have those tools
at your disposal, why not use them?
It actually adds to the effect
and it creates some more interesting
and more original works.
So the most important takeaway
from this is that you should always
experiment, try to figure out
what would be the most interesting way
to show your project.
If you can cut them out from
the background and add a little
shadow to them, that alone will
actually make it a lot
different than most of the portfolio
projects of other people.
That is because you actually
taken the time to make it
look more interesting while
most people just paste in some
images from the Internet.
So whenever you can go that extra
mile, because it's really worth it.
Okay, now we're gonna start with
a map view that we already created
in the first part of the course.
But if you haven't, there's one
thing that you need to always
remember when picking your maps,
and that is to color code your map
to match the style of the app.
Or if you can go with like a simple
black and white or grayscale map, like
in our case, you can get maps like
that from different providers, or you
can modify the visuals of a map
yourself to match the the app that
you're building.
Avoid using generic maps, the full
color ones that you can find
in many popular mapping sites.
What you can also do is edit the image
properties and modify the tint
or the hue in some cases, but don't
go too much in any direction.
So we don't really want a map that
visibly looks tampered with.
We want a tiny bit
of the color, if anything.
But as I said, you don't really need
to do this if your map is
already black and white and has a very
subtle color color palette.
In that case, it's likely gonna match
any app that you actually build.
So a small tweak can make sense
here, but I would advise against it.
But instead, just find a map
that looks good and avoid
picking the generic ones.
So I'm gonna bring it back
to the standard map that I had
in my very first iteration,
because it looks good already.
But we can make it look a little
bit more interesting by creating
an oval just above the map map.
And then I'm going to make it
a little bit of a circle.
And if you have a body of water, like
in this case the Baltic Sea, I'm
going to pick the color from the sea
and then just increase the
saturation a tiny bit so it's still
the same color, just a tiny bit more
colorful.
And I'm going to go to layer blur
and create a pretty large blur there.
And as you can see, the water now is
a little bit More interesting because
it's not as uniform form everywhere.
And you can add a couple
of these circles as long
as they're very subtle.
And of course, this is just
one way to make the map look
a little bit less boring.
But, of course, make sure that you
put it over water, because if you
put it over the streets, it's gonna
cover the streets, and that's not
gonna be a good mapping experience.
Okay, let's make a rearranged version
of this.
So I'm gonna duplicate the main
map screen, then I'm gonna remove
the tab bar and modify the main
top bar to actually be
at the bottom, but still be white.
And of course, my map had some
overlays at the top, so I'm going
to remove those or hide them
completely, and I'm going to move
the map a little bit higher.
And that locate me button
can be higher as well.
And of course, since we created
those overlays on the water, I'm
just going to move them up too.
So in this screen, we're going
to create an ordering card
with a delivery and tracking
of that delivery on the map.
So for that, I'm going to make the
card at the bottom a little bit
larger, and then I'm gonna move
the map so we see more of the
streets, because obviously the
delivery is gonna be through the
streets.
So here is the first thing that you can
do to create some nice map indicators.
So I'm gonna create a circle,
and I'm gonna fill it with the main
green that we have, the more
visible one in this project.
So the circle shouldn't really be too
big because it's not really clickable.
And I'm gonna use the green that
we used for the selector
in the main menu, but that may cause
some problems because it might not
be visible on some background.
So I'm gonna add a white border to it,
make it thicker, and as you
can see, it starts to look better.
But if we add a shadow to that border,
the shadow actually contrasts
with the white border
enough, so it looks pretty good.
The only thing left to do is to
modify the color of the shadow to be
a little bit more green to match.
And you can use this with
standard map pins as well.
But of course, since this is
the current location of
the driver, I'm gonna use the the PIN
as the final destination.
So I'm going to go into the menu,
copy the PIN that I created,
and then paste it onto the canvas.
And the first thing that we want to do
is to actually invert it, because
Currently, it's just a circle inside
a shape that's made with some borders.
So I'm going to invert it
into a filled shape.
If you don't know how to turn
the outline icons into filled
ones, it's pretty simple.
You just add a fill to them
and then turn off the border.
And, of course, you need to modify them
sometimes because of how they render.
So in this case, I need
to make some slight adjustments
for this icon to look good.
Okay, now let's add a color
to our destination.
And always make sure that if you have
two points on a map, they shouldn't
really be the same exact color.
So I'm gonna pick the darker green from
the top bar that we created before.
That will actually show that
these are two distinct
elements of the same path, and it's
gonna look a lot better.
Now, using the Path tool, just click
onto the streets and trace a road,
basically a road in which the courier
will travel with your delivery.
And it's really good to place
the points in a way where that path
can actually go through quite a lot
of different streets and avoid making
a, completely straight line.
It's good that there is some
turns because it's just gonna make
it look good in the project.
And you can turn that line
into pure green and then simply
move it under our objects.
And the next thing is
actually very important.
Make sure that your line is
at least three points thick.
And I understand that you might
go for, like, super minimalism
and super thin lines, but they
almost never look good.
So three points is like
the standard bottom line.
And of course, you can go a little
bit thicker than that if it
matches the style of your app.
If you have thicker icons or some
illustration, you can do that.
And you can also add a slight
gradient from between those two colors
to the line.
And if you don't like the sharp
corners, you can modify the joints
to be a little bit more rounded.
Of course, that all needs to match
the style and theme of the entire app.
So if your app has sharp
corners, keep them sharp.
Okay, now let's add some
details to the delivery.
So onto that white card
at the bottom, add a drop shadow.
And then in the settings of the it
just increase the blur.
There might be a natural tendency
to go with a negative Y value,
so the blur is more prominent.
But don't do that.
Keep it at positive or at zero because
it's just gonna make it easier.
Then I'm gonna scroll up
to the login and registration
and grab a couple of components.
So a Button, a form field, and a title,
and then I'm gonna paste them onto the
card, because since we already created
them, we can use them for this new
screen, and it's gonna make the sense.
So, first of all, I'm going to change
the title to Delivery in progress.
Now, we're not really going
to need a full form field here.
So first of all, I'm going
to move the title onto the card.
Then I'm going to go into
the field and modify the label,
because the label is actually
all we're going to keep.
So let's remove the form field
completely, and I'm going
to make two small text here.
One is going to be for the status,
and the other one for the eta, which
is the estimated time of arrival.
So I'm just gonna duplicate them
and change the first one to status.
But of course, judging on your app
and your project, you can have
completely different objects here.
You can have a, rating for
the driver, you can have the driver
photo, whatever you want
to make it interesting and original
and also, of course, useful.
So I'm gonna modify the status
from the main font and just
make it a little bit smaller.
So I'm gonna go with size 20,
and the status is gonna be on my way.
And then the ETA is gonna be
the time that the delivery
is actually estimated for.
So I'm gonna go with 7:32pm and to
make it stand out a little bit more,
I can change the color of that main
font to the green on the button.
Just make sure that the font is not
too light on the white background.
So if your color of the button
is pretty light,
avoid actually changing that.
So keep the darker shade
for the main information as well.
Well, and if you want to know where
to place that second font,
just create a 32 by 32 square,
and then align it to the very
center of this entire screen.
And then you can move the text
to align to that square.
Okay, the next step is I'm gonna move
it, and for now, I think I'm gonna
move it down because we might actually
add some little information about
the store that we're ordering from.
So for now, let's just
modify the button.
We can add.
Add a cold driver, and you can make
a photo of the driver here somewhere.
You can make an emoji, you can
add an icon to the button.
We already know how to do that,
but I'm gonna go with just a simple
button here, because as you probably
learned, high fidelity is not
about adding effects to everything.
Adding effects is really good if you
add it to one or two main things on
the screen and then you need to
click keep the rest pretty minimal,
but just well aligned and well
structured.
You can try playing around with
the line thickness as well if it
matches the rest of the app more.
But I think that this kind of line is
a little bit too thick for my taste,
so I'm just gonna go with like,
maybe 5 instead of 3, but still just
keep it above 3 if you want a nice
line.
Now, since we have a pretty visual logo
for my particular store, I'm
just gonna copy that logo entirely.
So it's gonna be the entire
thing, including the shadow
under, the shopping bag
and on it and everything.
And once you have all of those
layers selected, of course you can
group them as well, and then you
can copy it and then paste the
entire group onto the canvas of
our map view.
But of course, this bag is a little bit
too big and we have real text on it.
So the first thing to do is
to right click on the text
and use outline stroke.
And it exists in all design tools,
so you should be able to find it.
This basically converts our text
into a vector shape.
That way, if we lock the object
proportions, we can actually
scale it without breaking it.
And I'm gonna make this bag a little
bit smaller, and then I'm gonna place
it on the left side of the screen.
Of course, if you have a simpler logo,
you can use that here, or you can
use the driver information and some
additional options from other apps.
I'm just showing you a couple
of examples, but it's all up
to you to be creative here.
So let's just copy a little
bit more information here.
So I'm going to copy the name
of the store and add
a little bit of extra context.
If you're looking for inspiration
on what to place on cards like this,
you can go to Dribbble or
Behance and just browse some map
views to see what can be done.
Because just being inspired
by some concept makes sense,
but it all needs to fit your app, so
just don't copy it directly.
Make sure all the colors are right, all
the fonts are right, all the border
radiuses and everything else.
All the gradients, they need
to match the style and the theme
of what you're building.
They can't be a direct copy.
So just try to get some inspiration
on what else to put there.
And I'm gonna put the address
and a couple of other information.
So we can go with icons.
You can go without icons.
It's all up to you,
but it's really good to have a couple
of blocks of space.
So one block is the main title title.
The other block is the more visual one
with the logo and then the rest
is just some text and a button.
So I'm just gonna duplicate a couple
of things and just add
some meta information here
and I'm gonna align it visually.
But of course you can use the red
square method here as well
and it's gonna work just fine.
But designing very fast here.
I noticed that I copied some
very small fonts like size 10.
And 10 is basically only reserved
for the tab bar labels on
the main screens or main navigation.
So I'm just gonna increase that
font to 14 to actually be able
to read it on a mobile device.
And whenever you can always
export your images onto the phone.
There are some apps that allow you to
do it automatically from your design
tool, like Sketch Mirror for Sketch.
But even if you don't have tools
like that that just export a PNG
and browse it on your phone and
see if the fonts are the right
size so they are easy to read and
see if the buttons are easy to
click or tap.
The main thing about the map
itself is that it should be
very clear and very readable.
That why I'm always opting
for pretty monochromatic maps instead
of the standard colorful ones,
because the colorful ones are just
a little bit harder to process.
So as you probably see, the map
views aren't really that much
about the map as long as
it's pretty good color wise.
It's all about all the other elements
that you can do on the map.
So I'm gonna duplicate the main screen
and then I'm gonna make the map
larger and just keep the search bar.
And this is a very common look in
many projects to just have a floating
search bar on top of the map.
But of course it can't look
exactly like this because it's barely
visible and we need a little
bit more contrast here, here.
And if you want to know where
to place the search bar, I pasted
in the UI helpers element
that we created for the os.
So this is for the iPhone.
There's a different set for Android,
and judging by that,
the lighter red is the status
bar area and the notch area.
So I'm going to place the search box
in the middle of the darker red
rectangle and this is the best place
to put it so it doesn't overlap the
notch or any of the status bar icons
items.
And you can use a standard Drop shadow.
But for this element, I'm going
to go with the custom one that we've
created before in this course.
So I'm just going to create a rectangle
and this is going
to be a little bit smaller rectangle
than the actual search bar.
And then I'm going to pick the color
from the background here.
Of course, normally it probably would
have to be a color that just is
pretty neutral, but since we're making
a more visually oriented process
project, that should be fine.
And I'm gonna decrease the brightness
of that color by 10 and then increase
the blur until it's pretty blurry.
And as you can see, if it's placed
in this way, it creates
a very nice, realistic looking
shadow under the search bar
without overwhelming it.
And if you round that rectangle,
it will actually make that shadow
look a little bit more natural
because it will bend on the edges.
And if you want, you can round
the corners on the actual
search bar as well because that
can fit some of the apps.
And if it fits yours,
it should be good.
One thing about those floating search
boxes is that the fonts in them
in the placeholder text should be
a little bit thicker because they
don't have a background to fall on.
So it needs to be visible that you
can actually do something there.
And I'm also gonna decrease
the brightness of the font
a little bit so it's more visible,
there's higher contrast.
What you can also do is to increase
the height of the text field
to be larger than 44 because it's
now standalone, so it needs to compete
with the background better.
I'm gonna increase it to 50.
And here is a handy trick
to better align the icon.
First, I'm gonna move it
vertically into center.
And then since it's a rounded
shape, I'm gonna create a circle
that's the same height as
the shape, so it should be 50.
Now place the icon exactly
in the middle of the circle
and place the placeholder text
at the edge of the circle.
And then when you hide the circle,
you'll be able to see the icon well.
But I'm gonna duplicate it first
and then show you that if you're
using, point distances or an eight
point grid, it's actually good to
fit the actual icon in a, 16 size
circle in the middle of the big
one.
So as you can see, it just
works well in this example.
And of course, once we have this
first object on the map view, we
can start adding shadows or
rounding the corners on all the
other objects like the locator and
we can add some additional options
on the top next to the search bar
so we can make it larger or
smaller, whatever we wish.
The idea is that it doesn't look
boring and also it has to make sense.
So if there is the search functionality
and then locate me functionality,
they could be next to one another
because it makes sense logically.
So what we want to do here is
something that both looks good
but also makes sense in terms
of the information architecture.
So I'm moving the locator
up and I want to place it on the right
side of our search bar.
So first of all I need to align it
to the frame so it needs
to be 32 points from the side.
And then I'm gonna place it on top
of the search bar just to make
sure that it matches the search
bar and then just decrease the
size to width of the actual text
box.
And since we're using an eight
point grid, just make
the distance between them 16.
When we have a couple of objects
and they're all active so we can tap
on them and activate them, it's best
to have a slightly larger distance.
A gap of eight points probably
would have been too small.
And of course don't forget
to change the shadow
under the search bar to match it.
But of course you can try different
configurations or of something
that works well for your product.
So for example, I'm gonna move
the locator to the bottom back again.
So I'm gonna remove the icon
from within that circle and I'm
gonna move the circle to the left
side this time time and just
place it on the search bar.
And then just move the search bar
to the right and just make sure that
the right distances are still kept.
And then, in this case we have 32
on the sides and then 16 between them.
And then I'm going to go to one of
the screens that we've created before
and I'm going to copy the back arrow.
And of course if you already
have an icon like that,
you can just paste it in.
So I'm just going to paste in the back
arrow and using the color picker
to, I'm going going to pick the color
of the actual search icon as well.
Because that's what we want.
We want all the icons to be
consistent and also make sure that
those icons that you copied in are
the same width of the stroke that
the ones that you already have on
that screen.
If your map is pretty complex and you
don't have a body of water like I
have here, at the top, it's good
to create an overlay at the top of it.
So just above the map layer, create
an overlay, pick one of the colors
from the map, but likely
at the saturated one, and then just
change it to a linear gradient.
And that way you'll have a slightly
darker top, which basically
will give it more visibility.
But always keep it near to the top so
it doesn't obstruct most of the map.
And you can play with the opacity
of this object as well.
And there we are.
So to sum up, the map itself
should be pretty desaturated or
match the colors of your app.
This is the most important thing
when designing a map screen.
Because if you have a map that's very
graphics heavy, it has a lot of
different colors, different shapes on
it, it's going to be very difficult to
match the style of what you're
building and it's going to influence
the entire screen.
So that's the first step.
And you can modify those buttons.
Maps in many of the services, you can
edit the colors to actually match it.
And this is what actually
differentiates a great design
from a mediocre one.
That you took the time to modify
the map to match your style.
That's that last effort that people
subconsciously notice and they
know that this screen just looks
better because of that effort.
And after that, remember to create
visible pins on the map so you can
add a little shadow or a little
white border to it and a shadow to
make it stand out a little bit more
on any kind of background, any kind
of map.
And also you can add
some lines on the map.
You can add zones.
For example, if there is a zone
of delivery, you can create a zone
with like a semi transparent overlay.
Just be creative with the map
and add some stuff to it.
But don't add too much because
it's not really about
over complicating the map.
It has to serve a function
and all the things that you can do
around it them are basically
in the overlays on top of the map.
So the modifications to the map
should be small and subtle.
If there is one thing that
you should never complicate
visually, it's navigation.
Because this is the most important
part of any product.
Without it, or with an unclear
navigation or hard to read
navigation, it's gonna be very
difficult to actually use it.
So starting with some of the screens
that we've done in the first
course and you'll be able
to download all of them soon as well.
The first thing that I'm going to do is
add a background blur to the overlay.
But it's important for the background
blur to work so that the layer is
at 100% opacity and then
the fill itself has lower opacity.
So if your background blur doesn't
work, it probably because of that.
So I'm just going to decrease
the opacity to 80 of the fill and then
increase the blur a little bit.
If you're using a hamburger menu, which
by the way, is not the best kind of
navigation, you can play around with
different values for the overlay, but
it's good to actually have it there
because that will make the menu more
visible.
So while you shouldn't really obstruct
the menu, what you can do is try
to add some decoration to it.
For example, we had those floating
leaves on the login screen.
So I'm just gonna select them and copy
them, along with the shadow
and then paste them onto the artboard.
I only selected two of them,
one regular and one blurry.
And the regular one also
has a shadow to it.
And I'm gonna place them roughly
in a similar fashion,
overlapping the menu a little bit.
But you can try and play around
with a different positioning.
However, what we found out is
that if something is overlapping,
like a bitmap image is
overlapping the navigation,
you can add a nice animation.
When the menu expands or unfolds,
it will increase the high
fidelity effect on the menu menu.
One rule to follow is to stay away
with all the decoration as far as
you can from the actual menu items.
So don't make it overlap the menu
items or anything like that.
And what we can do here as well is
we can change the background
of the hamburger menu to a gradient.
And as usual, I'm gonna go
with a diagonal one because
they simply look better.
So as a reminder, if you're going
with a diagonal gradient, always
have the lighter color on top
and the darker one near the bottom.
And since we have a darker shade now,
we can modify the text on the menu
to be white and then also the icons.
The next thing that we can do is
add a little bit more depth to it.
So for now, I'm going to move one
of the leaves a little bit lower
and then I'm going to create
a new rectangle or just duplicate
the rectangle that we have.
Just remember to remove the background
blur effect from it and change it
to the standard blur, the layer blur.
And here what we want to do is
to create a nice blurry shadow
like we've done before.
So I'm just gonna blur it heavily
and then make sure that this
object is under the main menu,
but above that blurry overlay.
We want the shadow visible,
but not too strong.
So play around with this effect
until it feels just right.
Remember that if it's too
visible or too dark, it may be
overwhelming and it will actually
break the entire effect.
So I'm just playing around
with different opacity levels
and decreasing the size or
changing the color of that shadow
object to blurry object.
And once I'm happy with the result,
I'm just gonna keep it.
Okay, now that hamburger menu is
starting to look a lot better than
the generic one we had at the start.
Of course, you can still try to add a
little bit more to it and modify those
shadows and those gradients and play
around with different options because
the menu doesn't have to be that
bright.
So there's still a lot of potential
experimentation here that we're going
to do just around the hamburger menu.
And I encourage you to, when you're
building your own app, to always try
to make a couple of versions
of the main navigation and then pick
the one that fits the most.
So in this case, we're going to make
the overlay completely white, and if
it's white, it actually needs a little
bit lower opacity for the blurry
background to shine through.
And then I'm going to move
the leaf a little bit to kind
of have this effect
of the menu just whitening out the app
in the background and blurring it.
And of course, since we already
have a white overlay, we can go to
a solid color for our main menu
and then decrease the brightness
and decrease the saturation a
couple of times till we have a
darker shade and slightly more
desaturated one, one, of the menu
that we want to use.
And in this case, it's going
to have a nice dark menu, which makes
those leaves actually look a lot
better on top of it because they
stand out a little bit more.
Having a darker menu like that, if
the app is predominantly white, is
actually a very good idea, because
it will make all the important
elements in the navigation stand
out more, which is what we want,
because navigation is really
important.
Okay.
Since we have a darker menu,
we can modify that little selector
bubble that we have here
to a different color.
So I'm going to pick the green
for it and then modify
the text color to be white.
So one thing to always remember is
to have proper contrast and especially
for the menu items, so they're
fully visible and easy to access.
Okay, let's duplicate this
darker menu again and I'm going
to show you a couple of ways
to make your selectors a little
bit more interesting.
So the first thing that I'm going
to do is actually remove the roundness
on the corner and then I'm
gonna make it a little bit wider,
actually the full width of the menu.
And of course a full width
selector like this is a pretty
default way of doing it.
So this is not what we're after.
This is just the starting point.
So what I want to do first is
to decrease the width a little
bit and then duplicate
the element and create a little
line on the left side.
And then I'm gonna move that
line to the left edge.
I usually go with the width of four
points because I think that this
is like the best way to have it
still be visible but not too thick.
And then I'm gonna change the other
rectangle, the bigger one, into
a gradient that has the same color,
but it's vanishing into zero opacity.
And in the main color I'm gonna
decrease the opacity to 20%.
You can try different values
like 30% or maybe 15% if you
want a very subtle effect.
And as you can see, we now have a menu
that looks a little bit different.
You can also play with the gradient
handles so they don't have to be
at any specific point.
Just pick a point that you
believe that works best.
What you need to be focused
on, however, is that it shows
that this gradient actually
belongs to the menu item.
So it shouldn't be too small,
but it can be pretty big and it
can be vanishing almost
at the end of the menu item.
Okay, so we now have
a nice looking menu.
We have some leaves overlays on it, so
it's looking pretty high fidelity.
And of course, the natural tendency
here would be to paste in some more
objects, so some more elements like
maybe this pepper here or the carrot.
And this is very tricky because
of course, yes, we do have a lot
of white space in the menu here.
So we could just place some
objects there and it wouldn't
really hurt the navigation.
But this is not really a good idea
because most designs won't
really look good if they're
over saturated with elements.
So I'm not gonna go with
that, I'm gonna remove it.
And that of course comes
with time and with practice.
But it's really important not
to add too much to your design
because it's gonna look ridiculous
instead of high fidelity
as with everything we tried, remember
to be subtle, so don't overdo.
Okay, let's get to the tabs.
Now, which is the preferred type
of navigation for mobile apps.
And there is a lot of reading
material on it that you should
try researching a little bit.
Because tab navigation is the best
kind of navigation that you
can have in a mobile product.
So first thing that I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna change some of the colors
to some better contrasting
ones and the darker ones that we
already have in the top menu.
I also fixed some of the icons
that didn't import the best way.
But this is not really important.
So we have a menu that
looks pretty good.
All the icons are in the right place.
We have some selectors here.
Everything works.
Okay, let's make a couple
of different versions of it so you
can see what else you can do.
But just remember navigation is one
of the most important, if not the most
important element on the screen.
So you can't really go
too crazy with it.
So the first thing that I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take the background
object, so the background of our
whole menu, the white bar in the
background, and I'm gonna decrease
the width of it.
Now we have a 32 point margin on every
side of the screen, but we don't want
the main navigation to follow the
exact same rule because it will blend
too much with all the cards as you
scroll.
So always have it a little bit
wider than the rest of the.
That's why I'm gonna keep it
at 16 points on each side
and I'm gonna round it a little bit
and add a drop shadow to it.
And as you can see, it's starting
to show off a little bit
because of that drop shadow.
So now we need to modify the color
of the shadow and I'm gonna pick one
of the colors that we have here.
It's not that easy to pick actually.
And then I'm gonna do the usual
increase the blur and then
the Y value as well.
And just remember so that the blur
value is double the Y value
because it just works best way.
And don't go with a too big of a value
because that will make the whole
tab bar look a little bit messy.
Now let's bring all the menu items a
little bit higher, but we're gonna
have to decrease the width of them so
they're gonna fit on this new tab bar
because now it's not full width of the
screen.
So how to do that?
Well, by easy calculation, our new tab
bar is 358 points wide, so I'm just
gonna divide it by five and it gives
us a little over 71 point points.
So I'm gonna decrease the width
of every one of these elements to 71.
I do it pretty quickly because
this is a pretty boring task.
And of course, when you decrease
the width of an entire group,
some text may actually break.
So I'm gonna fix all of that.
And then what we want to do
is to align the middle icon
to the middle of the screen.
The item on the left should be
aligned to the left of our
new tab bar and the item
on the right to the right of it.
So always align the first, the middle
and the last items initially and then
just align the second and the fourth
one to be exactly between them.
And in my case, this is going to be
one point gap between all the items
to actually accommodate for that.
And that works great.
Okay, now let's duplicate that
second screen and let's play around
with some other effects.
So the first thing that I'm
going to try is to do
the effect of the background
blur that we had before.
So for that I'm going
to decrease the fill of the background
to 70% and change the effect
to a background blur.
And this can work if your app
has a lot of different, very visual
elements in the background.
So if it's like a photo sharing
app and the photos are
actually shining through
the menu, it can look very well.
But if your app has mostly
a white background, it's probably
not the best choice to go
with a background blur because it's
going to be barely visible.
What we can try here is to actually
make the background darker
and then decrease the opacity of it.
So it's going to stick out
more from the actual app.
And this is one way
of handling it, of course.
But it's still not a perfect
way because transparencies
generally rarely work well for
different navigation patterns.
So avoid, transparencies unless you
really, really want to use one.
And of course, you can try more rounded
corners and things like that, but it
doesn't quite work because we have
rounded corners in our cells here.
So if we go with fully rounded
pill shaped navigation, it will
look weird when the roundness
of the navigation is going to meet
the roundness of the list items.
So I'm just going to revert back
to the roundness that we had
before, which is not too round.
And of course, if you're going
with a darker menu like this,
that be sure to modify the colors of
the icons and the fonts to match it.
So never sacrifice contrast for
the sake of being original, because
this is the most important element.
If your main menu is
inaccessible, the app simply
is going to be unusable.
So to make it a little bit more
visible, I'm going to actually
make it a little bit less
transparent and slightly darker.
And I'll modify the shops element,
the shops title, in a while.
But those white letters are looking
way better on this background already.
Okay, let's duplicate the second
screen one more time and let's create
a different kind of bottom menu.
This time it's gonna be a full
width menu that's fixed to the bottom
but has some roundness on top.
This is a pretty common
way of doing that.
I don't think it's the best way,
but in some cases it might just work.
What you need to do is to change the,
the bottom corners to not be rounded
and then simply drag them to actually
be still within the screen boundaries.
Because if you're using a background
blur and your object is sticking
outside of the frame, it's going
to break the effect by adding some
little color overlay on the sides.
So we don't really want that.
And of course the white overlay,
like that on a white
background is barely visible.
So you can try experimenting
with some more colorful backgrounds
for the entire app.
But I would advise against that
unless your app is very image heavy
with a lot of large images,
you know that you're scrolling
through like a feed of images.
Then you can try a menu like that
and it should work very well.
So I'm going to change the background
of the app, back to white, because
I'm not a fan of that pale green.
There is one more trend that's been
popping out in app design quite
a lot, and this is kind of fake 3D.
So let's create a version of this
top bar that looks like this.
For that, I'm gonna duplicate one
of the screens
with the top bar that's floating.
So the second one, and after
I duplicate it, I zoom
in and let's select just
the background behind everything.
And of course, we don't really
want a drop shadow on it,
but for now I'm gonna keep it.
Now I'm adding another effect
and changing that to an inner shadow.
Now, inner shadows used to be
very uncool, in app design or
mobile design in general.
General.
But now I guess they're gonna
be back in style for a while.
So first of all, I'm gonna change
the background, the fill Color
of our rectangle to not white.
Because if it's gonna be
white, part of the top shadow
is not gonna be visible.
So it's just a very,
very light green that we have here.
And let's start with the top shadow.
So it's gonna be x equals
4 and y equals 4.
Blur can be a little
bit larger than that.
So I'm gonna go with eight initially
and change the shadow color to white.
But of course just one shadow is not
enough, so let's add another one.
And this inner shadow is
gonna be the dark shadow.
So the first thing we want
to do is to have negative values.
So minus 4 and minus 4 for x and y,
then 8 for the blur and then for the
actual darker color, pick a, color
from your background that has a
little bit of greenish in it and
simply decrease the brightness a
little bit.
And as you can see, we have this
kind of 3D looking shape or
element that is naturally
sticking out from the background.
Now if you want to keep the drop
shadow, make sure that it's dark
enough so that it doesn't really
create a blurry edge along with
the inner darker shadow at the bottom.
So in my case this is pretty blurry,
but once I increase the opacity
so the shadow is less transparent, it
starts to pop out a little bit more.
We don't want a fuzzy blurry edge here.
And you can change the fill color of it
to white as well if you have a shadow
that's going outside of it because
it's gonna make it work anyway.
We still have the 3D effect in place.
And if you're not a fan of this
shadow, because it's a pretty standard
looking shadow with not enough spread,
you can just remove it
and duplicate the actual item them.
And let's create a shadow
for it manually like we used
to do before many times.
So I'm just going to duplicate
it and then decrease the height
and the size of the element.
And of course we don't really want
the inner shadows on it either.
So for the color I'm going
to pick our green.
But of course it's not going
to be that green in the end.
We just want a good starting point
and the layer blur as the effect.
Okay, now let's go into our
color and then, decrease
the brightness quite a bit lot.
So it needs to be green, but it has to
be pretty desaturated and pretty dark.
If you're having a white
background and the main object is
white as well, try to make it
as desaturated as possible.
So we don't want it to be
very, very green because that
would just look unreal.
So in my case, I simply played
around with the shadow position
and the opacity, and with just a
couple of tweaks, you can end up
with a shadow that is looking
really nice under this inner
shadow tab bar.
Okay.
And since we have this very nice
looking 3D element, the natural
tendency is going to be to select
it, copy the properties, or copy the
style of it, and then paste it to
every other object that is also a
white rectangle.
Like this, right?
No, please don't do that.
This is the very bad approach.
You don't really want too many objects
having effects because that's gonna
make the whole screen look messy.
We don't really want a messy design.
We want something that
looks good and stands out.
And adding effects to navigation
can be a good way to make it
stand out, but adding effects
to everything is a pretty good way
for a really bad design.
So don't do that.
Instead, let's copy one of the top
bars again and let's create
a slightly different version of it.
So we had a rectangular selection
of a rounded rectangle here, here.
But let's change it to a circle.
So let's just create a new circle
within that group and place it
on the layer list below
the actual icon so it's visible.
And then decrease the size
a little bit so it's not too big.
We don't want those selectors
to be overwhelming.
But it needs to be bigger than
the icon, obviously it needs
to have some white space
on the actual background.
And I'm going to pick the same
color that we had for the selection
and then I'm going to duplicate
it and create a little element
ellipse just below it.
And of course let's go to effects
and layer blur and then move
this ellipse under the first
one that we created and then
just decrease the brightness.
And of course we need a little
bit more blur to it.
And if it doesn't look right,
you can always increase
the height of it as well.
Just play around with
a couple of options.
But what I'm after here is
a, slightly rounded shadow
under this rounded element.
So not a typical shadow
that it would create cast.
So this is one way of making it
a little bit more interesting.
And also all of these options,
the selector options, are visible
enough to be accessible because if you
just differentiate with color
alone, some people might not see it.
But if you're differentiating
with a shape, it's a lot easier
for them to actually acknowledge,
that this is the selected tab.
Okay.
But back to the design.
So the first thing that I'm going to do
here is actually change the color
of the icon and the text to our green.
And then I'm gonna create a little line
on top of the actual navbar.
And in many cases, that
line alone is enough.
So this is one way of actually showing
that something is selected.
But you can also do a gradient like
we did in the hamburger menu.
Just make sure that it's not really
that hard on the color side.
So you can just decrease the opacity,
for example, and you can
make the line on top of it a little
bit thinner if you want to.
And of course, now that we have our
white top bar, it's pretty good
to actually add a little shadow to it.
So I'm gonna remove the str stroke,
then select the background rectangle.
And if you can't select it because
of the helper elements, just find it
on the layer list like this
and simply add a drop shadow to it.
But there is one thing that
many people do wrong.
First of all, let's increase
the blur and many people
to make the shadow more visible, go
with a negative Y value.
And of course, yeah, that kind of looks
good, but it's not really a good way.
So if you want to have the shadow
more visible, go, go with zero or a,
positive value, because that way
you'll have all the shadows actually
pointing in the right direction.
So all the shadows should
actually be pointing down.
So the Y value should be 0 or higher.
And of course, you can modify
the color a little bit.
The saturated, make a larger blur.
Just play around with it.
Make sure that the opacity
is not larger than 50%.
And there are many different
ways of handling this.
So of course, that little gradient
overlay can be a little bit smaller.
So that's gonna make make
the icon pop a little bit more.
And you can play around with
a couple of different options.
You can try to copy it and then
rotate it 180 degrees
and put it at the bottom.
Just experiment with different
options, but make sure
that the icon is visible.
Okay, now let's make a darker
version of the same tab bar.
So I'm going to duplicate the screen,
select the rectangle
in the background, and pick our
darker color that we already had in
the hamburger menu before.
Of course, you can try picking
it off the icons as well, but it
might not be the best idea.
So I'm just gonna go
with the color that worked.
And now here's another trick.
This works on the lighter
backgrounds as well, but we're gonna
do it on the darker ones just
to have a different version.
So I'm gonna select the gradient
that we had, and I'm
gonna rotate it 90 degrees.
So basically, it's gonna be a gradient
on the side, and I'm gonna place it
on the line on top of the nav bar.
And now let's make those
colors a lot darker.
I'm gonna go with a brightness
of 10 on both sides of the gradient,
even the transparent side.
And that way we have, like,
a little nice indentation.
So this tab, the selected one,
is kind of pressed inside.
So now if I duplicate this
gradient and rotate it around
and place it on the other side,
we have sort of semi 3D effect.
And if it's not visible, you might
have to decrease the width
of the element or decrease the size
of the gradient like this.
And I'm gonna say it again,
because this is really important.
So play around with the values.
Always play around with the values
to make them match your
app, your style, but don't go
too hard on any of the values.
So your shadows or gradients or colors
cannot be too hard, too visible.
So as, in this case, I'm not going
for, like, purely black shadow here,
because that would be too straight.
I want something subtle that
shows that this icon is indented.
However, we don't really want those
dark icons on a dark background, so
I'm gonna change them all to white.
And then I'm gonna modify our selected
tab, slightly so it's more visible
next to all the other tabs.
And, of course, in many
cases, having just the line
on the top can be enough.
But let's go even higher
fidelity, and let's try to experiment
with something else.
So I'm gonna duplicate the line that
we have on the top here, and if
you can't select it, you can just
draw a new rectangle like this.
And I'm gonna pick the color
from the line for this.
So we have a rectangle.
Right?
Okay, let's do something with it.
So first I'm gonna increase the corner
radius to make it a pill shape,
and then create a layer blur for it.
So this layer blur should be pretty
big as well, but not to the point
where this entire object disappears.
So something along these lines.
And now place it on top
of the actual shape, but in a way
that it's still masked
by the actual top bar rectangle.
And you can create a nice Little glow
coming from that line that is not
as uniform as, like, a standard
fading gradient that we had before.
And of course, you can modify
this, play around with the shape.
It doesn't have to be a, rectangle.
It can be a full circle.
It can be higher, lower, different
opacity as long as the icon
is visible, but yet we still
have a little bit of a glow that
actually makes it stand out.
Because the point here is
to play around with these effects
and these options to create something
unique, something that is
different and that is basically
yours and also fits the app.
And of course, if you like this effect
but want to use a, white background
for the tab bar, you can copy
those light shadows, just play around
with their opacity so as well.
So once you figure out the best
possible navigation for your app,
just go along with it and make
sure that it's fully visible.
So don't go too crazy with different
colors, transparencies, or anything
like that, because that's gonna make
it harder to read, and that's gonna
render your app basically unusable.
Okay, now I duplicated that last
screen again, and I'm gonna
decrease the size of that line.
So it's not gonna be, be the full
length of the actual cell in the top
bar, but it's gonna be slightly
wider than the, icon that is below.
And if you're having a line like
that, you can make it a little
bit thinner, and also you can move
it a little bit away from the edge
of the tab bar background.
That's gonna make it more
visible and it's gonna make it easier
to actually notice it.
Some people just create a glowing
circle on top of it instead of a line.
So this is something that
you might also try.
But whatever you do,
the main rule is simple.
Your tab bar or your navigation
pattern, your hamburger
menu has to be accessible.
So don't sacrifice accessibility
for the sake of adding a couple
more glowing effects to it.
So don't play around
with the icons themselves.
You can try different icons, of course.
You can try a, filled icon
for the selected item, or
you can try a colorful icon.
But before you get to trying things
like this that, try to experiment with
just the backgrounds of your elements.
So in this case, I might make the top
two corners of my tab bar rounded if
I want to, and that's going to make
this app stand out and be a little
bit more unique from a typical app
design.
So just don't go too crazy,
because tabs and navigations are
the most important thing
and if you go with a rounded corner
for your main navigation, I'm
going to increase it to 32.
And now when I zoom in, you should
be able to see that where
the roundness of the top bar ends.
This is basically where
our main objects begin.
And this isn't really a good way.
So always make those roundness
ending a little bit further away
from the content, because that
can look pretty weird once you're
scrolling and there is a rounded
corner coming out of a rounded
corner.
So, yeah, messy and not
really a great way.
And of course, you can move that
blur to be under the icon, modify
the icon color to be white.
White.
Just play around and experiment.
And once you play around with a
couple of effects like these,
you can then start looking at
other apps and trying to get
inspired by how they do the
navigation and try to replicate
that navigation.
Because you never know, maybe
a different navigation pattern will
actually work for your product.
But still, I'm gonna
repeat it one more time.
You need to remember
for the navigation to be accessible,
readable, and visible,
so it cannot be too crazy.
And all of those projects you see
online with really crazy moving
animation in the navigation
are basically difficult to use because
they make the experience longer.
So they might look good, but they're
not gonna be usable and they're
not gonna be used in a real product.
So just keep that in mind and design
some beautiful navigation.
Cheers.
Okay, in this episode, we're gonna look
at the detail pages, which is
basically a product page, but you can
transform it to be a profile page or
any other page that's oriented on just
one thing.
So I'm gonna take one of the pages
that we created before,
and I already have an avocado that is
cut out from the background,
so I'm gonna place it at the top.
And for now, I'm gonna move all
of the other content away
from the screen so we have more
space to play around with.
If you don't know how to cut
out an image, there's gonna
be a whole series on it
in the decorations chapter.
But there are free tools that
you can use online to do that.
Now I select the background mask behind
the avocado and choose the fill
color using the color picker to that
green that we have here for now.
And I'm gonna remove this dark overlay
from the top completely.
Now, if you have your product already
cut on from the background, whether
it's a skateboard, a bicycle, or an
avocado, like in my case case, make
it big, because it's really what the
people are looking for on a page like
this.
So I'm gonna make it big and I'm
gonna make it overlap the background
a little bit because that's gonna
make it stand out a little bit more.
Now selecting the background again,
I'm gonna add a gradient to it.
This is a pretty standard gradient
where one edge is a little bit darker
than the other, but not too much.
So the brightness difference
is maybe 10 or 20 points.
And you can keep it vertical
if you want, but I always go
for the diagonal one, as you
probably know from this quad.
So you can keep it whatever you like.
Just remember that the darker color
should be closer to the bottom.
Now select the avocado
layer on the list.
So this is basically the bitmap
image and duplicate it and then
add, a layer blur, a pretty heavy
one, like 50, but you can play
around with a different value if
you want to.
The layer that's below
that will create a nice looking,
realistic shadow under the object.
And then you just need to move it
down a tiny bit to create a nice
looking shadow that matches,
matches the color of the object.
But of course, that's not all.
We can create a couple of ellipses
and using the color picker,
just pick the darker shade
of the object from the bottom of it
and then add a layer blur to that.
Experiment with some values
because it's not really that
easy to actually do it.
Right.
What we're looking for are some
higher contrast shadows where
the avocado is actually touching
the floor or the imaginary floor.
So just place it in the right spot,
make it a little bit smaller than
each of the fabric fruit, and then
place it below the actual images on
the layer list so they don't cover
it.
We don't want a shadow
on top of the image.
And now I'm duplicating one
of the shadows and using the mouse
cursors to move it around.
So it's gonna take some time,
but it will move to the right position
and that's probably the easiest way
to actually align, it.
Well, it's good to group those shadows
so you'll be able to find them easier.
Of course, and you should
name your layers.
But I'm going quick because
in this video I want to show you as
many different things or
different approaches as possible.
So I'm modifying the shadows
a tiny bit so they blend
in better with the object.
And after a few tweaks, it's
starting to look really good.
Okay, now we can start dragging
our groups back onto the screen
so I'm gonna select the group
with all the content for the screen
and I'm gonna drag it onto it.
And of course, we need to remember
to keep it at the same distance
from the left and the right side.
And this screen with the fruit
on the top, with the shadows, and with
the content built below already
is looking really, really well.
And we're only getting started with it.
Okay.
We're going to make some similar
products, but we're not going
to use the ones that we had.
So let's remove them and just
keep the card and the title.
And for that, I'm going to go back
to our login screens where we had some
additional vegetables and fruits,
and I'm going to select them all.
So I'm going to select the apple,
the pepper, and the carrot.
And of course, if you created different
objects, you should select them.
And I'm gonna paste them
in here because we're gonna
have three elements here.
And of course, for the carrot,
I'm gonna turn off the blur.
So let's start with the apple.
I'm gonna paste it on top of our new
card and make it a little bit bigger.
And what you can do, which is not
necessary, but it looks pretty
cool, is to have this apple, if
it's cut out like this, stick out
from the card on the top a little
bit.
Just avoid it sticking out too much.
A couple of pixels is enough
to break the boredom and not
break the actual layout.
So just like this is pretty fine.
Okay, now I'm going to select the text
and decrease the brightness of it a
little bit, because right now when we
have a lot of colors on the screen,
it's actually better to use darker
shades, so less saturated with our
main colors.
And I'm going to also decrease
the saturation as well.
And I'm going to do the same thing
with all of the content here,
especially the content that's longer.
We want it readable.
So in a case where there is enough
color on, on the screen already,
we can subtract some of it.
Just keep a tiny hint of it,
of course, in the main color,
but the darker shade will work well.
Okay, let's change the title of
the screen because it's not actually
a piece of bread, it's an avocado.
So let's make a change to reflect that.
And remember to always make
the text match the image.
So if you paste in a bicycle,
name that bicycle something.
Don't use a generic title
for every single screen because
that's gonna look fake.
And of course, here as well, there is
the natural tendency to go for some
more images, some more graphics.
So you might be tempted to grab
those leaves from some of the top
elements and then try to modify
them and add them to the screen.
I don't believe that's a good idea,
but of course it can work sometimes.
So let's face them in and just
to see what can happen.
And yeah, you can try to align them on
top of the avocados or somewhere else
on the side or have the blurry
one somewhere back in there.
But this adds a little
bit too much complexity.
So I still am always for an option.
Okay.
You can even try to actually attach it
to the avocado if you can,
and make like a fake version.
But I'm gonna go with removing
those because I don't think
that they contribute anything.
The actual image
of the avocado looks good enough.
So just remember, design is reduction,
but let's bring
in the similar products categories.
So the first thing that I'm going to
do is modify that background rectangle
there, and I'm going to remove
the border and add a shadow to it.
And of course, this shadow has to
be a little softer, so I'm going
to go into the settings of it and
I'm going to pick a color from one
of the greens that we have right
now.
But then let's decrease the saturation
and then increase the Y
value and increase the blur.
We want this shadow to be very outside
of the object and of course
decrease the opacity as well.
So we want it soft, but not too soft.
And this is still
a little bit too hard.
But first I'm gonna increase the corner
radius of those cards to 16 points.
And then let's play around with
that shadow a little bit more.
So what else can we do?
We can decrease the opacity even more,
and at about 20%, I think this
is the effect that I'm after here.
So let's actually duplicate
this and place it at eight
points, like as we had before.
And then let's replace the apple
on the second one with the pepper.
And, this is gonna be
a similar scenario.
So let me mention this.
If you're making a different
shop, obviously, because that's
the whole point, you need to be
aware that it's really good to have
have different kinds
of products for your visual shots.
So if you're making a bike shop,
for example, don't add similar
products as only bicycles.
Add some additional accessories to
them like helmets or bags or
anything, because that's just gonna
make the screen look more real than
if it was like the main screen of a
bike and then a lot of smaller
screens of bikes as well.
That's gonna look boring.
And I'm using the duplicate
the image and blur it
for creating that shadow here.
And of course, that shadow needs
to be a little bit less vis,
so I'm gonna decrease the opacity.
And now, since these objects are
not really that essential, you
can decrease the size of them.
The photos need to be a little
bit smaller so we can still fit
a little bit of text onto them.
And of course, for the peppers, I'm
gonna group them and I'm using a
couple of different techniques, so
like a standard drop shadow or a
blurry shadow under these objects
to show you that you can actually
try and experiment with having a
lot of these techniques in one
screen.
Okay, now I'm gonna duplicate
this object one more time and create
the card for the carrot.
And of course, the carrot normally
would probably fit somewhere that
would be mostly behind the
screen, but if you can make it
stick out a little bit like that,
it's gonna make this screen look
better.
And of course, we're only talking about
presentation purposes here, and having
an empty card as the last one
would simply look a little bit weird.
Okay, now let's actually bump
the fidelity a little bit more here.
And I'm gonna change the font from
Poppins to plus Jakarta Sans,
because I think that as far as free
fonts go, this font is likely one
of the better ones that you can
actually use.
And I think that this change
makes the design look a lot better,
even more than the cutout
Avocados with nice shadows.
And of course, we don't want
light or thin fonts, so I'm
gonna change it to medium.
Okay, now let's copy the style
and paste it onto some
of the other text elements
on the screen so they're consistent.
And.
And let's change this one
to plus Jakarta Sans as well.
Seriously, this font is
really, really great.
So I'm gonna quickly modify all
the remaining fonts on this screen
to also be in that font.
And after we're done with this,
let's play around with some additional
high fidelity options for this.
If you see me making changes
in the position of elements,
it's all based on instinct.
And of course, you should use the red
square method or any other
alignment method to actually align.
Align it precisely.
I'm just using my experience
to align it really quickly because
I want to show you as many
different techniques as possible.
Okay, I'm adding some titles
to those cards now.
And of course you can add
longer titles as well.
But it's best that if this is
just a secondary element
on the screen, something
at the bottom of it to fill it.
It's really best that those
names are pretty short.
In a real app, of course, the names
can be as long as they need to
be, but this is not a real app.
This is gonna be a, project that
we're gonna use to showcase a couple
of nice design techniques.
And just as with the carrot image,
I want this title to actually stick
out a little bit so it's still
visible, even though it's short enough
to actually be hidden completely.
Many designers forget
about this little detail.
And then they'll have the third card
looking practically empty because both
the image and the title title don't
really fit within the field of view.
Okay, now let's select all
of those titles for the cards
and bring them together.
Just make sure that they
are on the same height.
They need to have the same position
vertically, and then I'm going
to bring them up closer to the images.
Okay.
And this is the very first option of
a higher fidelity design than we had
in the very first part of the course.
This is looking pretty good, but based
on this screen, we're going
to create a lot of different options
that you can play around with with.
One thing that I want to do here,
however, is that this title,
the avocado title, which is
the main text on the screen, is
still a little bit too thin.
So I'm gonna select it
and change it to extra bold.
It's still a very subtle difference,
but it makes it pop a little bit more.
And what you can also do is
modify the colors, the brightness of
the colors to be a little bit darker.
Because as I said before, if
you already have high fidelity
image images in your design,
you can then resign from some
of the color in the text.
Of course, it still needs that hint
of the main color in the gray of
the text, but it can be significantly
darker or a little bit less saturated.
It's going to look good anyway.
I noticed some of my icons are a little
bit too thick compared to one another.
This is probably because
of the Figma import, and I always try
to fix this whenever I see it.
So at the end, end of the day,
the icons need to have the same
stroke with all of them.
Okay, so we have our starting point.
This is a very simple version
of the screen, but let's duplicate it
and play around with this some more.
So first of all what we can do is
to increase that colorful background,
the green background, to be actually
as high as the entire screen.
And obviously you could
leave it like that.
Of course, modifying the text
to be more visible on that background.
And this is, of course, one
option if you want to go
with a more colorful app.
But I'm going to modify it even more.
So I'm going to copy one of the card
backgrounds and paste it just on top
of that background that we have here.
And since our distances from the sides
were 32, I'm going to keep a distance
of 16 for this card on both sides.
I want it to start just above
the title, but below the image.
And we'll modify
the exact position later.
But of course, let's stretch it
towards the bottom of the screen.
We want it to be.
Be the full height,
the full remaining height.
And what I noticed the first thing
is that the cards don't really
look that well because they're
white, they have a shadow, and
they basically look pretty
similar to the actual card in the
background.
So you can modify their color as well.
You can make them a little bit more
colorful, but decrease the saturation
or decrease the brightness
and make them darker so they'll pop
more against that background.
But we already have one screen that's
pretty minimal, the one on the left.
Left.
So let's modify those cards even more.
I'm gonna make them darker and I'm
gonna change the text color to white.
And as you can see on that dark
background, those colorful
shadows from the images are
actually looking even better.
And you could keep the internal
margin at 16 just as it is right
now, but I'm gonna go with 24.
So I'm gonna create myself a red
square for this occasion,
and I'm gonna make it 24 by 24.
And of course, change the color to red.
And then using that square, I can align
all of the elements within the card
to be 24 points from the edges of it.
So let's start with the text.
I'm going to place the square
next to the edge of the card
and simply modify the visual alignment
of the text so that the first
capital letter is touching it.
And then let's decrease
the size of the button as
well and then move it up.
Move all of those ratings and labels
and the text and everything.
And if you like the initial padding
of 16 points, you can keep it.
But just make sure that within your
card, the margins, the paddings
are not bigger than 8 points.
An 8 point distance is reserved
or should be reserved
to only the smallest of elements.
So all of the bigger elements should be
at least set 16 points.
But 24 is, I think, the sweet
spot for most of them.
And I even like using 32 because
it actually makes all
of the elements even more readable.
And of course, I need to align
the main text, the body copy
on the other side as well.
So simply wrapping it
like that is fine.
It doesn't need to touch
the separate edge.
You don't need to make it
justified and please don't.
And I'm gonna also center the square
and align, that second line, the last
purchase one to it, and then
the button on the other side as well.
Well, now let's move
the cards a little bit.
So just select all of them and move
them so they are touching that
red square on the left side.
And of course, since they are
horizontally scrolling, the last one
is still being cut off by the screen.
And that is all fine.
If you're having a darker card, you
can actually use a pretty cool effect
by adding a radial gradient to it.
Just make sure that the opacity
is 100% on both sides sides.
And then you can play around with
that radial gradient by decreasing
the brightness of one of the sides.
And as you can see, this creates
a very nice effect,
of course, if you don't overdo it.
So the difference between
the two gradient edges
shouldn't be larger than 20.
And I like this effect.
So I'm just gonna copy it and then,
paste the style or the properties
onto all of the other cards
that makes them stand out from
the background a little bit more.
And of course, if you make them
that way, just make sure
that they don't have a shadow.
Because darker color
cards, casting a darker shadow makes
the edge of the cards blurry,
and we don't want that.
Okay, the next thing that I'm gonna do
is increase the height of the button.
Before, we only had buttons
that were 44 points high.
And that is okay because 44 is like
the minimum of what a clickable
button looks like on mobile devices.
But I'm gonna go to 50 and you can
even try going to 60 in some cases.
But it needs to actually fit the entire
app.
For me, 50 is like the sweet spot
for most buttons that I'm making.
So 50 it is.
Now, I copied the style or
the properties of my cards and pasted
them onto the price tag.
And since we're using rounded corners
for some of the buttons, like
fully rounded, and they are actually
pretty user friendly in terms of
the emotional value that they bring.
I'm, gonna round the corners
of the buttons completely, completely.
So it's a pill shaped button.
If you want to have your background
card more visible, you can decrease
the brightness of the shadow there
and then play around with the values.
I'm gonna decrease the Y value
and go with a slightly larger blur
that will make that shadow
more visible on the canvas.
And this is basically what we want.
But what we can also try is
to actually bring it higher to the top
and make the avocado
image overlap it a little bit.
Because generally, normally this
is the sad truth, but high
fidelity design is all about breaking
some conventional rules.
So if you can do something that is
overlapping something else,
it instantly brings the design
to a higher level of visual fidelity.
It's actually mixing graphics design
into the UI design genre.
And since we already created a couple
of nice looking high fidelity
buttons, we can go to the playground
section and find one that's
gonna gonna fit this screen.
And of course we can modify the colors.
And I'm not gonna go with blue
because the app is not blue, but I'm
gonna go with orange because orange
actually fits the green pretty well.
But if you don't have a button
that fits your app,
just modify the colors on it.
It's pretty simple.
And I'm gonna decrease the height
of the button to 50 because it was 60
before, and make it the actual size
of the button that we have underneath.
Then simply modify the color
of the icon and the color of the text.
And with just that simple change, we
have a higher fidelity screen that's
a little bit more unusual and it's not
as boring as like a typical minimalist
screen that we've done before.
Okay, let's quickly make
another version of it.
So I'm gonna duplicate it and I'm gonna
go to our login screens when we
created a couple of nice looking
buttons and, and I'm gonna pick one of
the buttons with the arrow and I'm
gonna go with the green one because
it's really juicy.
We want our main CTA to be
visible on the screen.
So I'm just gonna paste
in this new button here.
And of course it's
a little bit too wide.
So what I'm gonna do is I don't want to
stretch the circle or the arrow icon.
So I'm gonna first align it
on the right side and then select
just the green background
and align it on the left side.
That will will make the arrow
and the circle stay in place.
And of Course it's not register,
it's adding it to the cart.
So I'm just going to change the title
on this button again.
Make sure that the text or
the label is perfectly aligned
in the middle of the button.
And then let's remove that arrow.
And what we can do here is
grab that cart or shopping bag icon
that we had before the darker one
of course, because on a white
background it's going to be visible.
And yeah, first I'm gonna change it
to add to bag because we didn't
have a cart, we had a bag.
But of course if you had a cart,
you just paste in a cart icon here
and that creates a nice looking button
with an icon and larger text.
It's super important however,
that the icon is exactly
in the vertical center and also
the optical center of the circle.
And I'm gonna decrease the button
height a little bit as well and play
around with this heights because
this button seems a little bit too big
for this crowded screen.
If you have a lot more white space
on your screen, like for example, if
you don't have the similar products
category, you can make a larger
button and it should look good.
Okay, now let's modify the circle
position so it's exactly four points
from the edges of the object.
And I want to decrease the size
of the text because we decrease
the height of the button.
So I'm gonna go from 19 to 16
and this is gonna be a sweet spot.
Of course the text can be a little bit
on the bigger side because
it's an important action.
But the button itself with the icon
and the circle is already
pretty visible on the screen.
So for buttons like that, it's actually
good if you can fit the same text
three times vertically on a button.
This is kind of how I
manually or optically select
the proper text height.
And if it can fit a little
bit more than three times
times, it's still fine.
Just don't ever go below 16
point text on a button because buttons
really need to be big enough.
Okay, now I duplicated the screen
one more time and then let's
move it a little bit away from
the other screens and let's use
the oval tool to create a circle.
And I'm gonna paste that circle, copy
it first, and then of course paste
it behind everything, just on top
of our main green bottom background.
And just make sure that it's
exactly in the center.
And what you can do right now is
to change it to black.
And some people just use some
opacity here like that.
So if you Decrease the opacity to 10%.
You have a nice kind
of rounded element on top of it.
But I'm gonna go with
something even more fun.
So I'm gonna create a linear
gradient, but I'm gonna
replace the actual edges of it.
So the gradient starts with a, 10%
opacity dark black color and then it
fades into 0% opacity near the top.
And that simply looks a little
bit more organic and nicer.
And don't worry, we're going to bring
a button to this screen in a while
because it just copied without it.
So I'm just going to leave it at that
and duplicate the first screen one
more time because we need to try
a couple of different options here.
Right.
So I'm going to change the color
of this background here to solid
and I'm going to change the color
of it actually too white.
So we're going to remove this entire
thing and create a more minimal high
fidelity screen, because why not?
But since we've done that, let's
select all of the objects on top of it
and let's change the colors of them
so they are actually visible.
Because if you go with white
for everything, it's actually going
to make it difficult to see
on a white background, obviously.
So I'm just going to select one
of the colors that we had here.
And of course you can tweak
that color a little bit.
Like, okay, so now we have an avocado
on a white background.
So what can we do with this?
Well, the first thing that comes
to mind is actually using
that circle idea again.
So I'm just gonna paste it
one more time and place it
near the top of the image.
And of course it doesn't
have to be black.
You can add a little bit of green or
your main primary color to it to make
it match the rest of the app more.
But just having a little bit of like
a, background on top of a white
background around is actually adding
a little bit more fidelity and make
this screen look a little bit more
interesting.
And of course this circle can
be an oval, can be wider,
or if you're not a fan of circles,
let's create a square.
And I'm going to round the corners
of it, rotate it 45 degrees,
and then I'm going to place it
in the background again.
So just going to copy it
and paste it under our object.
And what you can do here is
of course increase it some more.
More play around with these shapes
in the background and then position
them in a way that they don't
overlap the text, but they do
overlap the image a little bit.
And then just simply copy the style off
of the circle that we had before.
You can now remove that circle
and then paste that style
onto the newly created rectangle.
And of course, by pasting the style,
I also removed the corner radius.
So I'm gonna bring this back
and play around with the value.
That looks good.
It can be a very, very
rounded range rectangle.
And also you can modify the linear
gradient to actually be
more in where the action is.
So I'm going to modify it so that the
darker shade starts where our
rectangle, or our square is visible
at the bottom, and then it fades
into white or into transparency near
the top.
And of course, you can also do that
with a little bit of a color in it.
You can just try and experiment
with different options, because
breaking down a product page like this
is a great way to make it look more
interesting and less generic.
And if you have more white
space like that, it's all natural
to pick a larger button.
So I'm gonna replace our yellow
button with the bigger green one
and of course, just modify the width
of it to actually fit it.
So I'm gonna be 32 points
on the left side and 32 on the right.
And to make it easier, because the
right side is more complicated, I'm
gonna align it on the right side
first and then just simply drag it
to the left and make sure that your
text label on the button is
centered.
Some small adjustments to the contents.
So I'm gonna make the spacings
a little bit more even.
But of course, you should use
a red square method or any other
good alignment method for this.
And since this screen is pretty
minimal, we can remove the background
from the price and then
simply pick a brighter color for it
and then increase the font.
Because sometimes having too
many different objects and shapes
on a screen, especially if
you have a high folder fidelity
image at the top, can actually
make it feel cluttered.
And when we have a lot of space,
it's also good to increase
the size of most of the fonts.
And if your body copy, the main
long text that you have is
about 14 points, go with 16.
And try to never go below 14,
because in most phones, it's simply
too small on a mobile device.
And as you can see, just those
simple changes made the screen look
a little bit more refined,
even though it's still pretty simple.
But it does look higher fidelity
because of that little
ellipse under the photo
and the overall minimal feel.
Okay, so let's duplicate this
entire screen again and let's make
another version of it just
to show you a couple of examples.
But of course there is
a ton of possibilities.
You can experiment with pretty much
every idea that you have here
and try different tweaks to it.
So in my case, I'm gonna copy the
style of the gradient background
that we have on one of the colorful
screens and then I'm gonna paste it
onto the circle on top of the other
one.
And as you can see now, it changes
this entire screen drastically.
And of course what we need to do
is also add white icons to it.
So I'm gonna remove that set of icons
and just paste in the white ones so
they're visible on the background.
And of course you can try
to make it asymmetric.
It can be higher, it can be lower,
it can intersect with the image.
There is is like a ton of choices,
but if you're doing intersecting,
and as you can see there is this
little triangular gap between the
avocados, try to have that
intersecting circle actually go
through it.
So we don't really want it to
touch the edge of the avocado.
If it's intersecting,
it should intersect.
Okay, one more quick version.
I'm going to duplicate this screen
again, and then I'm going to duplicate
the circle in the background
and then I'm going to place one of
those circles on the side like this.
And of course then you can duplicate
it one more time, make it even
smaller, because if they're both
the same size, it's gonna look boring.
And place it somewhere
along the left side.
There are a couple of places where
you should put it, but generally
we need some visual balance
to the entire screen and that
gives it a more playful approach.
And of course those bubbles could
animate, so there's a lot of cool
possibilities for this screen.
Another option is making one
of the buttons a lot darker, because
of course we already have a lot
of green on that screen.
So if we make it darker, it's
gonna instantly stand out.
So I'm gonna go into the button
and then decrease
the brightness, holding the shift key
by a couple of tens.
And then like at 19, it's
probably pretty good.
But of course we don't really need
that light shadow under the circle
here because it looks weird.
So I'm gonna hide it.
And now I'm doing the trick that we
all know and love, which is creating
a nice looking new shadow under the
button by just duplicating the
button, making that shape smaller and
of course, you can increase the
brightness a little bit because if
the button is dark, we want the
shadow to contrast with it.
Then add a layer, blur
and blur it to your liking.
But of course it can't be
either too big or too small.
And then simply place that
blurred image under the button.
And of course, if it doesn't show,
like in this case, you might have
to play around with the layer list
a little bit because some of those
layers or those groups can be
clipping.
And if something doesn't quite work,
instead of modifying the groups, you
can just ungroup them because this
is a quick, high fidelity exercise.
And then you can group everything
together after you're done.
So I'm gonna decrease the opacity
of my shadow and play around with
the placement a little bit to have
something that I'm happy with.
And after a couple
of tweaks, this screen is starting
to look pretty good.
If you want the button to be higher,
of course you can increase the shadow.
If you want it to be low and just
a, little bit pronounced, you can
decrease the size of the shadow.
It's all up to you.
And once you have a couple
of different approaches or different
versions of your detail screen,
you can go into one of them
and start modifying afterwards.
So I'm gonna click into this one
and I'm gonna make my cards
with the similar products darker.
So just simply decrease the brightness
by 20 and then decrease the brightness
of the first one by 20 or maybe 2010.
You can try playing around
with those values until it fits
something that you want.
So in my case, it just makes those,
cards a little bit darker and more
pronounced against the background.
And I really like that approach.
So don't be afraid
to change and modify things.
If you like something, then
just taste it in, see how it
looks like, and, experiment.
Because this is the whole reason
for playing around with high fidelity.
You want to add some emotion and some
feeling and some actual uniqueness
to the project and you can't really
do it by planning ahead too much.
So play around with the values
and see what comes out of it.
And if that requires you to make a lot
of different screen versions,
that's fine, because the product
screen is one of the most important
screens in any ecommerce app.
So you can create a couple of
versions using these simple techniques
based on the pretty much
the same information architecture.
But even though those screens in
terms of the flow and the
information architecture look
practically the same, they are very
different in terms of how they are
received by the user they have very
different visuals.
And if you want to go even more
minimal than that, because a lot of
those dribble shots and a lot of
those portfolio projects are super
minimal on purpose, you can
actually remove the similar project
products and then move all of the
other stuff down.
That will give us a lot more space
to play around with the actual images
and with the actual visual of it.
So I'm going to copy in one
of the cards and paste it
under our content so to be sure
that it's fully visible.
And then increase the size
of this new card so it actually
fits the entire screen.
And once we have that card ready,
I'm going to increase the corner
radius from, from 16 to 32 and then
select the card, go into the
shadow, and then decrease the Y
value to zero.
Don't go into the negatives
as we explained before.
But zero is gonna make it
actually look pretty good.
And I'm not gonna create
a new rectangle here because
we already have the circle.
So I'm gonna enlarge it and place
it under our newly created card.
And if it's not exactly under,
just move it around the layer list.
And as you can see, there is a small
gap on the left side of the card.
So I'm gonna it fill fix that quickly
by just moving it to the left
and then expanding it by a couple
of points to the right.
And if you're not happy with just a
plain green background under your
item, you can add a rectangle on top
of that green background and play
around with some, gradient overlays
that can actually make it look a
little bit more 3D.
So I'm just gonna make a gray
rectangle, change the color to black,
and then simply change it again
to a, linear grid gradient.
And this actually naturally creates
this linear gradient that fades
into the bottom, which is fine.
And if you decrease the opacity
a little bit, you can have an effect
of like a, fading floor.
And if you don't like that
effect, you can actually duplicate
this entire element and then
simply move it to the top
and then remove the bottom one.
And that actually makes it look
even more like it's sitting
on the green floor in a green room.
But which is basically
what we wanted here.
This effect can be used
to your advantage if you have more
three dimensional product.
And even if you have like a bicycle
or a skateboard, it can look really
cool on a background like this.
Of course, make it your color that
matches the theme of your app.
And of course we need to also
Modify the objects that we have
here a little bit as well.
So first I'm going to bring
everything a little bit higher up
and of course the distance from the
left side for the text should be
the same as the distance from the
top or right.
Roughly the same.
And then let's move the button
to the bottom because you know, in E
commerce it's actually very important
to have the button within reach.
So the main button is basically
where your thumb is supposed
to be on the screen.
And this positioning works for both
left handed and right handed users.
Okay, so we moved the button,
but now we have this huge
gap between the content.
So let's select the rating
and the last purchase element
and move them down as well.
And you can leave pretty big spacing
on a screen like this.
So a space of like double
the margin is completely fine.
Okay, now let's do something
with the main description text.
So I'm gonna click into it, select it,
and then move it down a little bit.
That's the first step.
And then let's decrease the brightness
of this text because we
already have a lot of color
on this screen so it doesn't have
to be dead green in the gray.
And now I'm gonna use the golden ratio
rule to calculate the line height.
The golden ratio number is 1.618.
So basically if you multiply your
16, which is the font size, by that
number, you round the resulting
number to the closest digit and you
have a line height that actually
perfectly matches the size of your
font.
And I'm not gonna play around with
the copy here, I'm just gonna modify
it slightly so it matches a little bit
more what we have on the screen here.
So it's not a bread.
But of course it's important
for the content
to match the screen design.
Design.
And now I'm gonna create
a couple of categories.
So I'm gonna use the cards that
we created on one
of the previous screens and I'm gonna
paste them onto this screen.
Just one of them is enough.
Okay, moving it up a little bit.
And then let's position the title
so it's in the right spot here.
And then decrease the height
of the card.
And we don't really want
any specific height.
It can be 44, it can be smaller.
It depends if those cards
categories are something that you can
actually tap on and get to it.
So I'm gonna rename
the category to Superfood.
Decrease the width of it a little
bit and then decrease the width
of the back of the card.
And now once we have an object
like that, we can modify
it or we can duplicate it
and add one more category.
And for most portfolio shots
and high fidelity designs, it's not
necessary to create more than
two categories, even though they
could be sticking out of the screen
to make it more interesting.
But I think that having just
two is a good way to have
a pretty minimal screen.
If you already have a pretty visually
heavy top of the screen, that gives
us plenty of white space on the right
side for this design to shine.
And if you want, you can also
select the card in the background
and then decrease the brightness
of the actual shadow and then
play around with the values.
Just keep the y value at 0 or above.
And as long as your opacity is below
30 or 40%, you should be fine
with almost any value that you like.
But as with everything in high
fidelity, we don't want a very
strong and hard shadow.
We want something that's subtle
and just pretty minimal overall.
So making some quick alignment changes,
moving stuff around a little bit.
And you can use the red square
method for this as well.
And just like that, we have another
screen that is looking high
fidelity, but at the same time
time, it's really pretty simple.
What's good about these kinds of
screens is that if you don't have a
product that you can easily cut out
from the background, you can still
have a photo of that product on the
top.
The card in the background
can simply cover it.
And of course you can also make
a dark card for the entire background
and play around with dark
mode or make a version with a,
more visible, lighter button.
Whatever you do, don't
stop experimenting.
Play around with almost every possible
option, look for inspiration and try
to replicate some ideas you found on.
And don't be afraid to create a lot
of different versions of your screen.
In E commerce, especially, the product
screen is the most important one.
So this can actually be your
starting point of any app design.
And that can lead you
to influencing how the rest
of the app is going to look like.
So, as you can see in about 30
minutes, we created a lot of different
versions of the same screen.
And don't be afraid to use
this approach for your hyphen
fidelity designs.
If you have your first version
created and you're happy with
it, still duplicate it and play
around with some options on it.
So make a, different background, make
a different overlay, make a different
shadow or a different framing around
the objects, or remove something.
Because sometimes the best
ideas come from actually having
a lot of different things.
And then Removing one of them
and seeing how it will look like.
So don't be afraid to experiment
because high fidelity is all about
practice and all about that
experimentation and always coming up
with a new solution or a new idea,
not, sticking out to the first thing
that comes to your mind.
Okay.
Previously we created a lot
of nice looking detail pages.
Now let's use some of those pages
to create some overlays.
But also let's use some of the concepts
that we learned in this course already
to create some onboarding screens,
because onboarding screens are very
popular in portfolio showcases.
So I started by duplicating one
of the screens, and you
can pick whichever you like.
And then I'm going to create the
actual model or overlay next to the
screen so it's a little bit easier
for me to lay everything out without
being obstructed by the content on
the screen.
So first I'm going to copy some
smaller text and then paste it
onto that new little overlay.
What I want here is a confirmation that
the product that we're looking
at has been added to the shopping bag.
So first of all, I'm gonna need the
product name, and it's probably best
to make it a larger font and then a
little bit of a description that is
actually telling us what's gonna
happen.
Okay, now I'm gonna make the title,
which is basically the product
name, a little larger because it's
gonna show a proper hierarchy.
And also because this is the more
important element because.
Because this is what we're
adding to the shopping bag.
And one thing that you can do is that
if your screen is already pretty
colorful, like in our case, you can
actually make those fonts darker.
So I'm gonna decrease the saturation
a little bit and then
decrease the brightness as well.
Okay, we have our text, but of course
we're gonna need the photo as well.
So I'm just gonna, drag the text, move
it a little bit to the side, and then
copy and paste the entire group
with the avocados in my case.
But of course, in your case, it's
gonna be a different,
different object that fits your app.
Make sure the proportions of
the object are locked, and if they're
not, just use the shift key.
And then I'm gonna make it smaller
and place it onto the card.
Now, once you add the image,
the visual balance of this
entire card is shifting a little
bit more to the left.
So first of all, I'm gonna
counterbalance it a little bit
by increasing the line height
between the two text lines.
And then, of course, we can also
make the main title a bit.
Little, little bit thicker.
That will actually counterbalance
the photo, and it will make it
all match a little bit better.
But that only works great because that
font, even in the thickest of
the settings, is actually pretty thin.
If your font is super thick, I
wouldn't really go with that option.
Okay, so now let's make this whole
card a little bit taller, and let's
paste in one of our buttons.
And I'm gonna call this checkout,
because this is gonna be the main cta.
We don't really need that
button to be as big.
So I'm gonna decrease the height to 50.
It's still really good
for a mobile button.
And then I'm simply gonna make
it a little bit smaller and move it
to the right side of the card,
and we can do proper
alignment a little bit later.
For now, I'm just gonna duplicate it
and create another button next to it.
And for this button, I'm gonna change
the text to Continue shopping.
And I also noticed that I duplicated
the label twice, so I'm gonna
remove one of the them and then just
paste the continue shopping one.
Okay, so we have two buttons,
and for many people, this is fine.
No, it's not fine.
If you have two buttons, one
of them has to be primary, which is
the checkout, and the other one has
to be visually secondary.
So it cannot look the same.
If you have two buttons next
to each other that do different
things but look exactly the same,
this is the wrong approach.
So I'm not going to leave it like that.
Of course.
Course.
Now, since the Entire screen uses
32 as the main margins on the left
and right side of the screen, you
can use 24 on every side within
the card, and then 8 between the
cards.
And that is a good starting point.
But of course, the card is completely
detached from the screen right now,
so I did it kind of out of habit.
And we'll have to realign it once
we put it back onto the screen.
Okay, now let's modify that secondary
button to actually look like.
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
pick a, very light, very
desaturated version of that color,
kind of like this, and we don't
really need a shadow for it.
And, usually those secondary buttons
really shouldn't have a shadow.
In some cases, they can be just text.
We couldn't have a white text on
such a light background because that
would just be horrible contrast.
So I'm gonna use the color picker
to pick the color of the title.
And this is starting to look a lot
better because even if, if the button
itself is not accessible,
the dark text on it is accessible.
So for many people,
the primary button is going to be
visible and the secondary
one can appear as just text.
And it's going to be fine.
What I did now is that I selected
the background, pressed enter,
and then selected just the two higher
points and then changed the border
radius for them, and I picked 32.
You can try a different radius
yourself if you want to.
And now I can move the card
back onto the screen.
And of course, when I make it wider,
I notice that I have to adjust
some of the sizes a little bit.
One thing that is important for
portfolio project and it's a little
bit less important for real coded
apps, is that if you have a button
right above the card like this, like
the add to back button, it's really
good to have this card overlap the
button a little bit and not end
exactly at, the edge of the button or
a little bit below.
It's just, just gonna look better.
So now I'm readjusting the buttons
to still have 24 points from each
side and eight points between them.
Now we can move the Avocados a little
bit to the left side and also I'm
gonna make it a little bit bigger.
If you don't have a cutout from
the background object here as
the product, you can always use
a circle with the photo instead.
We will be checking accessibility
elements and contrast a little bit
later in the course, but I decided
to actually decrease the
brightness of my main green,
especially on the background
buttons, just by 10.
So I'm going from 79 to 69.
And it's looking a lot better
because the buttons and the text
on them are just easier to read now.
So some small adjustments and you
can use the red square method
to actually find the right spacing
between all of these elements.
And what I'm changing now is
I'm decreasing the blur of
the actual shadow under the Avocados,
then decreasing the opacity
and also decreasing the opacity
of the added shadows.
Because the object is much
smaller right now, so it doesn't
need that huge shadow.
Okay, now let's create an overlay
that's going to go under the card
and it's going to make it actually
stand out from the background.
So this is basically
going to be a shadow.
And for that I'm going to pick our
green and then going to decrease
the saturation to Almost nothing.
And then decrease the brightness
very low as well.
And then change this
to a linear gradient.
And then what you can do is just
to replace the gradient edges.
So the bottom one is actually starting
with the color and the top
one is going into transparency.
And now we have a nice looking overlay.
So simply drag it under the group
with our card
and then adjust it as you wish.
It's good for that shadow to not be
too strong and also make sure that
there is no little gap on the edge
of the rounded corners like this.
So just to make sure that the actual
overlay stick starts at around
the place where the roundness start.
And you can make it larger, you can
make it a full screen overlay so
it doesn't have to be a gradient,
it can go over the entire screen.
It's all up to you.
And once we have a component
like this, we can start
modifying it a little bit.
And I'm actually going to address one
of the biggest problems that we
encountered in the first course.
Because many people try desperately
to fit longer text on different
buttons and basically shrinking
the text doesn't quite work.
So I'm going to duplicate
the screen and I'm going
to make a standard pop up.
So this version of the overlay
for now is just going to be attached
to the bottom of the screen,
but we'll tweak it later.
And then what we want to do is
to decrease the size of our
card and also to move the buttons
underneath one another.
Because if you have a longer text,
we might want to have longer buttons.
And, and we don't always need
to have them side by side.
In a case where we can't fit
things, it's best to just place
them one above the other.
That is also safer for translations
because many languages like for
example, German have very long words.
So sometimes if you translate your app
to German, you realize that
a lot of the stuff won't fit.
And this is one example of how
you can actually make it work.
Okay, so I'm going
to decrease the width of our
background here, here.
And the idea for this is that if you
already have a card in the background,
like in our case, this new
card shouldn't be the same size.
So as you can see, we still have
a little bit of that card
in the background sticking out from
under our newly created pop up card.
If they were exactly as wide as
one another, it will simply
disappear a little bit and blend in.
And we want them actually the users
to see that there is a new
layer on top Top of the rest.
So this is what's enabling us to do it.
Of course, the pop up card can
also be a little bit wider, so it
can have like a distance of 16
from the edges of the screen.
Whatever you wish, but it's really
good that it doesn't have
the exact same size as the card
that's already there behind it.
So now I'm adjusting the buttons
so they have 24 points from every
side of our newly created card.
And for now, to make this a little
bit more visible, I'm actually
gonna reduce the transparency
on, the background gradient so
it's gonn almost more opaque.
And also I can decrease the brightness
on one end as well.
So this new pop up is just
going to be more visible.
But of course this can also be
a solid color with transparency.
It can even be a solid black as
long as the transparency is good
enough so it's not too dark.
Okay, now let's play around
with the card itself.
So first of all, I'm going
to decrease the size of it
so it matches the buttons.
And since they are too 24 points
from the left and the right, I
want the bottom button to be 24
points from the bottom as well.
And then I modified the border
radius of the card to match
the border radius of the buttons.
And as you can see, it all goes pretty
nice diagonally around the button.
We don't want the exact same border
radius because that would actually
create this gap that we talked
about in the other course as well.
And you can also experiment by dragging
your object on top of the card
and make it overlap it a little
bit and then centering the text.
Text.
If you prefer the version from that
very first example, you can of course
leave it in the popup as well.
And I'm gonna rotate the overlay
because there is already
an avocado in the background.
So I don't want it to be too visible
because having an avocado on top of
an avocado is a little bit too much.
Now, since the distance between the
buttons and the edges of the card is
24, then I'm gonna keep the distance
between the buttons 16 and then make
sure that the text is actually in the
middle of the photo and the, first
button.
So this is a lot of the very main
concepts that you can use
for those higher fidelity cards.
And of course those cards can be
taller, larger, they can have
form field elements in them,
they can have sliders or graphs.
You need to experiment with that
on your own, because right now
we're going to create something
a little bit more interesting.
We're going to be making onboarding
screens, which are those screens
that you basically scroll through
at the beginning of most apps.
And while they're not the best way
to actually introduce you into the
app, because they actually add a
little bit of friction, they are
often one of those screens that
can have the highest fidelity
because they can be the most
experimental.
So what I did here is that I
duplicated one of the login
screens that we had and copied and
pasted it the style or the
properties of the darker green
gradient that we have.
And I'm also going
to increase the border radius
of this top item here.
And before we get to the actual
changes, I'm going to remove
most of the content here because
we only need the visual.
The onboarding screens are basically
one of the most lazy designer
exercises, because you can do them
pretty quickly, and you can actually
drag and drop external images.
You can get 3D images from
free libraries, and that 3D
image is actually making most
of the design more visual.
And you can quickly just add an image,
add a little bit of text under
it, and you already have a screen
to showcase in your portfolio.
I'm not saying you should do it this
way, because it is pretty lazy.
And those screens don't really
contribute anything to any UI design.
They simply look nice and they
are very easy to make.
So instead of just dragging
and dropping some 3D images, I'm gonna
play around with what we have.
So, first of all, I'm gonna increase
the size of everything, and then
I'm gonna move stuff around so it
overlaps in a much better way.
And as you probably remember
from the previous videos, we
don't want those decorative
elements to all overlap.
So, for example, I'm not gonna place
the apple overlapping the edge, but
one of the leaves can be
overlapping, and then on the other
side, some of the other objects can
overlap as well.
This adds a little bit
of nice complexity to this, and it
adds some nice fidelity.
But if you overdo it and you
place all the objects on the edge,
it's not gonna look good.
Okay, so I'm gonna write the title
for our first onboarding screen, and
mostly is best to actually write a
pretty large title, because these
screens are something that people
scroll through very quickly, so you
need to be sure that they're gonna
read it.
Okay, I'm gonna go with a size
40 and then decrease
the brightness a little bit.
And, yeah, it looks pretty good.
Now I'm gonna center that text
and usually it's best to not only have
this one text on the screen,
but also have a little bit of extra
contextual text underneath that.
And usually the second text is smaller.
Try to avoid having three
different kinds of text
on these onboarding screens.
Two is more than enough.
One big one and one smaller one.
And if you can, of course
in a real product, it's best
to actually onboard the users while
they're actually using the app.
And there are many ways to do that.
It's basically a, material
for another course.
But of course those onboarding screens
are something that is worth to have
in the portfolio because they're easy
to make and pretty visual so they can
attract some eyes and some attention.
So I added a new text, I
wrote something that, that
I just feel is right.
And what we also want is for that
text to be slightly lighter,
but we don't want it super light.
We don't want the contrast
to be very low.
So I'm gonna make it a little bit
lighter, then center it as well and
then place it under our main text
and make sure that they are both
centered horizontally on the entire
screen.
So you can just select
them and center them.
And you can either keep 24
as the distance from the edges
on each side for the entire
screen text box or 32.
24 might be a little bit too low,
so I'm gonna go with 32.
And for that smaller text, I'm gonna go
with a little wedge shape.
So it's kind of going down vertically
and it guides our eyes to the bottom.
But you can always break it down
like this and that is also fine.
I usually, prefer the smaller text
to have this wedge shape because
that just drives our eyes
towards the buttons or towards
towards the additional action
that we want the user to take.
So in many cases it simply helps.
Okay, now let's copy the two
buttons that we had on one
of the screens on the left side
and paste them onto this one.
We want them near the bottom because
they are easy to reach with the thumb.
So one handed use of the phone
is not gonna be distracting or
it's not gonna be difficult.
With this product and in onboarding
especially, we want the user
to be able to quickly
skip or to quickly proceed.
So the first button is self
explanatory, but then the next
button is actually moving
you forward in the carousel
in the onboarding process.
So I want the user to understand
what they're going
to find out in the next step.
So that's why I'm naming
it how it works.
And then I'm going to paste
in the arrow that we had
in one of the other screens and then
simply move it to the button.
And of course, the arrow is
pointing the wrong way, so I'm going
to use the rotation value
to add, 180 degrees rotation and,
and simply turn it around.
Then I make sure that all the content
in the buttons is properly aligned
and that the distance between the
button is smaller than the distance
from the button to the edges of the
screen.
Okay, but we still have a lot
of white space here.
And of course, we could leave
it like that, but it's not really
going to look that good.
White space is good, but it's not
perfect where there is too much of it.
So let's actually move everything
down a little bit and let's
increase the size of our visual.
And because we have so much space
and we want those buttons to be easy
to press, you can actually experiment
with a larger version of them.
So you can actually create
a version that's 60 points high.
And it's gonna be helpful for the users
because it's gonna make it easier
for them to actually access them.
Okay, now let's make the top
visual a little bit bigger.
So I'm gonna first increase
the background element
and then increase the corner
radius quite a bit.
A lot.
And what you can also do is go
to the options there
and do corner smoothing.
It exists in Sketch the same way,
and it helps you to actually smoothen
the little edge here so this
corner looks a little bit better.
And now we can just simply
move some of the stuff around
so it's more distributed.
But we don't really want to enlarge
anything because the idea is that if
we make all those images larger, it's
still going to be pretty cluttered.
And what we want is a little
bit more background and those
objects simply occupying
different positions around it.
So I'm just gonna group my shopping
bag logo and place it exactly
in the middle and then move some
of this stuff around to
figure out the best position for it.
And of course, you can never
figure out the best position.
Very quickly, just play around
with those objects and see what works.
The rule is to try and distribute
those objects as much as possible
around the main object, which
in our case is the shopping mall bag.
But we don't want them actually
too much in view.
So we can, for example, move one
of the objects a little bit outside
the screen or make it larger
and make the other one smaller.
Just make it look like there is enough
white space on that background still.
And if you want, you can actually
copy one of the leaves again,
like in my case, or one of the
objects that you have there in
your app, and place it a little
bit outside of the boundaries of
this.
They will add a little
bit more effect to it.
I usually avoid copying the blurred
ones too much because as
you can see, if you place it
on the green background like this,
it's gonna look pretty messy.
But yeah, this is looking pretty good.
So let's make the second screen.
And since this is an, onboarding
process, which is you scroll
left and right, you can actually
increase the size of this
background here because the middle
one can simply be around.
So you kind of start with a pill
shape and then you drag it
to the left side and you reveal
the rectangle the other part.
And in the middle part we can
have the leaves again, but make
sure to place them at a
different positioning because we
don't want the people to
actually notice that everything
is in the same place.
We want them to actually
move a little bit.
And of course always modify the text
and really just write anything that
you believe that matches that screen.
It doesn't have to be super high
quality copywriting, just
something that comes to your mind.
But avoid using Lorem ipsum or
avoid using some generic text.
And always spell check what you write.
So make sure that there are no
typos or words that don't exist
in the English language because people
subconsciously notice that.
And if they see those words with
typos or errors in them, they will
basically look at, at this design
with a little bit more criticism.
And that's not what we want.
Okay, for the middle screen we can
create a different kind of visual.
For example, we can create a, map view
in case of a store that does delivery.
And nothing shows delivery better
than showing a map with your
current location and possibly even
a couple of stores selected.
And if this is too difficult for
the developers in the real product,
you can always just pick a random
location in the country and it
can be pre filled or pre made.
Okay, so what I'm creating here
is a circle and you can play
around with different
border values for this as well.
I don't think I'm going
to use a border, but I am
going to use the shadow.
So what we want here is to add like
a little bit of dark green shadow
with a, pretty heavy blur to the
object, kind of like this, and then
use this object as a mask for our
map.
So I'm going to copy the map from
one of the map screens and then
simply paste it over here, here,
and then paste it on top of our
circle and then simply mask them
together.
And if you have some objects that
are overlapping a circle like
that, avoid having those little green
triangles like as I have here.
Usually just try to cover
that little edge if you can.
That's gonna just simply make
it a little bit cleaner.
And when you have the map in place,
you can rotate this elements around
it so it matches the style and just
make sure that they really, really
look different than on the first
screen.
Then I'm gonna grab the pin that we
created for the map before and
simply gonna go back to the map and
then paste a couple of these pins
around the map to show that there
is a variety of locations that you
can order from, which is basically
what customers want from an app
like that.
So I'm gonna distribute
them pretty evenly.
But of course keeping in mind that
there is the whole sea of water
on the right side of the photo.
So I'm not gonna put any
storage under the sea.
And the locations should be
distributed around the map, but they
cannot look like they were placed
in like a perfect rectangle or
a perfect circle around something.
So try to make them, look natural.
And now let's create a nice
shadow for under the circle.
So I'm gonna pick the color from one
of the leaves and then decrease
the saturation and decrease
the brightness a little bit.
Then simply use the layer blur as we
have before to create a nice
looking shadow that's gonna be
attached just to the bottom of the
object and then simply drag it from
the top on the layer list to more
of the bottom.
So it's under the actual map circle.
And we don't want it to be that strong.
That's one thing.
So you can either move it down
behind the map circle a little bit,
or increase the blur,
or decrease the opacity or both.
We want those shadows to be subtle
because a lot of that high fidelity
design is also about subtlety.
So nothing should be very hard
and striking and very contrasting.
And by contrasting, I mean of course,
things like decorations or shadows.
Because your buttons and your
labels on the buttons
and form fields and elements
should be pretty contrasty.
And if you think that the circle
is a little bit too boring
for you, you can actually
expand the mask a little bit.
So you can create a couple of extra
circles of different sizes around
your main circle, like this one,
one, and then simply add them
to the mask, which works this way.
You select all the circles and then
the circle that is the mask.
And simply use the union Boolean
operator, which is basically
the thing that you use to connect
two different shapes together.
And when you do that, and you select
the right image inside the mask,
you should be able to actually have
the map shine through all of them.
And if this happens, then it means that
you need to just remask it again.
So use that new shape as
a mask for the the map.
And as you can see, we have a
slightly more interesting shape,
but you can still modify it by
expanding the group and then, for
example, decreasing parts of those
circles or moving them around, and
the map will still be shining
through them.
So you can try some
different approaches.
You can even have tiles of the map
with different sizes, rounded
rectangles in a grid, and some
of them being bigger or smaller.
It's all up to you.
Try to be creative
with the this technique.
And since we have a new circle at
the bottom of our map, I copied
the shadow from the main big
circle and made it smaller and
placed it under the smaller
circle so they all cast a shadow
like this.
Okay, now let's duplicate it again
and simply move it around.
So right now we will have like,
the final chapter or final element
of our onboarding process, which
is actually going to still connect
to the previous, previous one.
And if you have a couple of screens
like that that are obviously connected
and one is after the other, you can
actually present them visually in
mockups or in case studies in a very
nice way.
And since this is the last one
in the onboarding, I'm gonna
modify my decorative elements to be
in different positions again
so it's not gonna look boring.
For the last one, I'm simply gonna
paste the photos of the avocado.
And if you want a more logical
direction of that, probably
the avocado should be on the first
screen, then the map, and then
the bag at your door.
But it doesn't really matter
which direction you put them in.
Just make sure to write the right copy
and add this nice image there.
And of course, this is not
going to be everything.
So after I'm finished writing the copy,
we also need to add that little
indicator of on which part
of the onboarding we actually already.
And some people just use dots for that.
But there is one way that actually
looks a little bit better.
And of course, since we have a couple
of different buttons here, I'm
going to modify the second button to
actually match what's going
to happen on the last screen.
And then the last button on
the very last screen is simply going
to go get you into the app.
So this is going to be
the button that ends the tutorial,
and that also means that we don't need
need a Skip tutorial button
on the very last screen.
And as you can see, my typing skills
aren't always perfect, and I
made a typo here, but sadly, we're
gonna have to leave it at that.
Of course, there should
be a T in there.
And try to always check this, because
that also shows that even I'm
making mistakes like that if I'm
trying to go a little bit faster.
But that's okay.
Let's just make this last button
to be the largest ones,
because that's the button
that takes you into the app.
And then I'm going
to create three circles.
And for now, they're even going
to be rectangles, but I'm
going to round them completely
with the corner radius.
And the first one is going
to be a little bit wider than
the rest, because that's
the first selected option.
So once you have a shape similar to
what I have here, and you're sure
that the distance between all the
three objects is the same, simply
move it to the center of the screen
and then you can modify that very
first object to.
Well, for many people, the obvious
color would be green, but I
don't think that's the best
color because we already have a lot
of green on that screen.
So it's best to actually
pick a different color.
And I'm going to pick the darker
color that we have for the font.
And then I'm simply going to move both
the indicators and the fonts a little
bit higher, just by 10 points.
And of course, use the red
square method whenever you can
to align it it perfectly.
And now simply, I'm going to duplicate
those objects, and if you do it this
way, and if you bring one of those
dots onto this side, and then simply
move that element, you will be able
to have it in the right place every
time.
And I'm going to do the same
thing for the last one.
But first I'm going to select the group
and align it to the center.
So just duplicate the dot, place it on
the line, and then simply move that
little selection to the end of the
last dot so it overlaps the last dot,
and then remove it, and then simply
center this as well, and that creates
this perfect alignment and it's pretty
easy to do.
And that shows also on which screen
in the onboarding process we are.
And you can also increase
the line height a little bit.
You can simply multiply the font height
or the font size number by
the golden ratio number, which is 1.0,
and that should give you a pretty good
value for the line height.
Okay, we have some very nice
onboarding screens, but that's
not the whole story.
So let's duplicate all
of them and place them underneath
the main screen.
And what we can do now is rotate
some of these objects like this
and then try to realign them as
we did in the login screens.
But this is gonna be pretty tough.
This angle, this particular angle.
So I'm gonna go with a slightly lower
one which is gonna be probably around
16.
What we want is a shape that starts on
the left side and then that would
actually go through all of the
screens to the very last one and
still have enough of that green on
the last screen.
So I'm gonna rotate all of the other
objects to the same value of degrees
and simply move them to match.
And that way we'll still gonna have
an onboard that has three screens.
And when we actually move them between
the screens, it will have this nice
effect that all of those background
elements are fitting together nicely.
And this is also going to make the app
look a lot more interesting because
of that, especially when you show
those screens side by side like this.
So if you're creating a case study for
your portfolio and you need some quick
high fidelity screens for your app
that you already designed and did, all
of the other steps of the UX price
process, you can actually quickly
create some nice high fidelity
onboarding process screens and place
them near the top because this is
where your app starts.
So this makes sense.
And I'm going to modify some
of the objects now to
look better compared
to the new shape that we have.
So just change the distance, change
the size and the position
until you're happy with the result.
And high fidelity doesn't mean that you
need to use strong colors every
everywhere as we had in this detail
page here, I'm gonna copy the
properties or in sketch, copy the
style of the object.
And then I'm simply gonna duplicate all
the onboarding, screens one more time
and then simply paste that new style
onto the objects in the background.
And once you're done pasting it onto
all of the objects, you'll notice that
this creates this very subtle and very
nice looking effect in the background.
And, and it actually plays very well
with the high fidelity images of
the leaves and the map and the shadows
and the avocados and everything.
And to make it more prominent, you
can increase the opacity of it,
for example, but not go too far.
So 20 in my case it's a little
bit too strong, but something
like 10 looks a lot better.
And this adds some nice looking
depth to the images without
overwhelming them with color.
So you can try examples like this for
all the different shapes that you can
think of for the onboarding process.
And knowing what you know right now,
you can look for inspiration on
sites like Dribbble or Behance and try
to find a couple of examples
of how other people do onboarding.
I would advise against very strong
gradients like black going into the
green as I just shown before,
because that can make it look a
little bit too condensed on the top
the of side.
So once you have images
on the top, it's best to actually
make it pretty subtle like this.
And of course the shapes can
be different and the experimentation
is pretty endless.
But the main important thing about
the onboarding is that you should
always think of it in three sections.
So I'm just gonna create those sections
here as a little wireframe or mock up
that's gonna hopefully make it
easier for you to think about
onboarding screens in, in the future.
So the first thing that we have here
is the key visual image,
then the text and then the button.
And the button always has
to be at the bottom because this
is where our thumbs are.
So yeah, it starts with the key visual.
And the key visual should be about half
the size of the screen vertically,
leaving the rest of the space
for the text and the button.
And you don't really need
more space for the text.
Trust me, in onboarding
the text has to be very short.
All good onboarding screens
follow this pattern.
Sometimes they do have an X in the top
right corner, but in most cases you
should really focus on the key visual.
And for many design exercises, if you
want to create something that looks
good very quickly, keep in mind that
if your key visual is taking over
half of the screen vertically, if you
find a nice image from the Internet,
even like a free 3D image that you
can get from, from some libraries
that you can use in your projects and
of course credit the author, that's
very important.
But if you have that image, that's
going to be something that's going to
make your screen instantly stand out.
And the, rest of the screen is
actually very simple, just
some text and some buttons.
And you already have a nice
looking image for your portfolio
with barely any work.
But of course I encourage you
to do onboarding screens, but only do
them for, for the actual apps.
Because I think that showing just
onboarding screens in your
portfolio without any extra
screens for the product is going
to be a dead giveaway that these
are just quick artworks and not
real projects.
So in this video I've shown you a
couple of different techniques to
first of all create overlays and pop
ups, but also to create onboarding
screens, which are a, very fast and
easy way to make some more visual
screens for your app.
Because you can't really experiment
with some screens like
the checkout process or the login.
You simply can't or they
will be not usable.
But with the onboarding screens you
can go pretty crazy with the visuals,
which is a good exercise
to actually train that high fidelity.
So try to research, other onboarding
screens, try to find out what
other people do and how they do it.
And knowing these techniques, can you,
you should be able to actually create
completely different onboarding
screens for every app that you make.
And just don't be afraid to play
around, experiment and be curious,
because that's the whole point.
You don't follow the rules every time.
You just need to know which
rules not to break and then
break all of the other ones.
Creatively, those screens are the best
way for your app to stand out to
the users when they're first using it.
So, so be really, really
creative about it.
But of course it has to be
readable, usable and friendly.
Okay, here we go with what I think is
the most differentiating aspect
of this entire high fidelity process.
Decoration.
Decoration is what makes your
design stand out and what
makes it unique and original.
And also a lot of the decorative
elements don't have to be accessible
because they're not necessary
for the entire user experience.
So as long as you keep the experience
part, which is the buttons,
the labels, the form fields, etc.
As long as they're accessible,
you can play around with some
very nice options for the decoration
to make it stand out.
In this video, we're gonna go
through a couple of different
decorative elements and it's
gonna be pretty long, so you can
actually digest it in parts.
We're gonna start with photos that
we already had in the login screen.
So I'm gonna paste in a photo
of a spinach leaf that I found online.
You can use free websites like
Unsplash or Pexels for this.
And then using the pen tool,
simply trace the image,
just clicking around the edges.
And it doesn't have to be super precise
as long as the image, the original
one, is pretty big because at the end
we're gonna actually shrink the
element and all of those little errors
or little gaps in that trace are gonna
disappear.
So just click around it.
You can use the actual roundness tool
as well, like this one, and that
can make it look a little bit better
if you want to keep it larger.
Now, this takes a while of getting used
to, but this is actually a fun fact.
This is something that I have been
doing as a designer back in the late
90s and the early 2000s to most
of the photos, because we didn't
have auto repair removal tools.
And even though there are websites or
apps that allow you to remove
background from images, it's actually
good to learn this technique anyway,
because this can come in handy with a
lot of different things in high
fidelity design.
And later, when you start designing
landing pages, you can also cut
out a lot of elements this way.
So learn this technique and then you
can try using the background removal
tools that you can find online.
So as you can see, I'm
tracing the believe.
It's not super precise,
but it's gonna be good enough.
And also what's really good
about this, that at any point
you can refine the selection.
So it's actually easy
to fix if anything goes wrong.
Okay, just finishing the stem
here and then just close off
the selection by clicking again
on that very first dot.
And this works the same
in every design tool.
The next part is pretty simple
because we've done this before.
But before we do it, I'm gonna
actually turn off the borders
and turn on the fill.
So as you can see, there is a little
bit of the leaf actually sticking out.
But I'm gonna pick that vector
and on the layer list, drag it
below the image and then simply use
the masking tool to mask them.
And as you can see, the image is
now cut out from the background.
But if you zoom in really close
and you press the enter key, you can
actually modify the points still.
So if you don't like how it looks, you
can always change it and update
updated, which is a very good way to
actually doing this because if you
remove the background in an external
tool, then you'll be stuck with that
image forever.
And once we have that masking
group, you can make it larger,
smaller, or rotate it
in any direction that you want.
And of course, we're going to make it
smaller because we want to add this
leaf to our onboarding screen that we
created before, probably instead of
that leaf that we have here, the
blurred one.
So I'm just going to click
into it and remove it and Then
I'm gonna drag our new
spinach leaf onto the artboard.
As you can see, it looks pretty good
as it's cut out from the background,
but it doesn't really fit
the color scheme of the actual images
that we have on this screen.
So I'm gonna modify this.
And many of the design apps,
design tools, have an option
like this where you can tweak
the temperature, the saturation,
the contrast, and so on.
This is great because that allows you
to have consistency within
all those images, and those images
should really become consistent.
So our leaf was initially darker,
and I'm tweaking the exposure,
saturation, temperature,
and highlights to make it lighter
like all the other leaves
that we have on that screen.
Once I'm happy with the result, I
can make it a little bit smaller.
And then what I want to do is
to actually duplicate this
entire group one more time.
And you can move it just
to see that it's duplicated
and add a layer blur to it.
This is gonna serve as our shadow.
So I'm gonna use a larger value, like
3:30, and then simply move it under
the image and also move it under
the image on the layer list as well.
If you want to make it easier for
yourself, you can rename the groups
to Leaf and Shadow, and, yeah, simply
bring it below, and then you can
tweak the brightness and the blur a
little bit to make that shadow look
more realistic.
And the most important thing
about shadows is that they need to all
be coming from the same light
source or from the same direction.
So as you can see, the leaf on the top
left of the image has a shadow that's
slightly diagonally to the right.
That means that our, newly created
shadow should actually be in that
same direction, because if it's on
the other side of the leaf, it's just
gonna make our brain go crazy.
Not all of the elements need
to have stronger shadows.
But just to practice this a little bit
more, I'm gonna create the shadow for
the apple using that same principle.
So I'm just.
Just gonna pick a darker green
color, and I'm gonna use the leaf
for it, because why not?
It's still the same general palette.
And then, of course, we'll go
with the layer blur and then increase
the blur to maybe 40, and then
simply move it under the Apple.
And if 40 is too much, you
can decrease it to 20 or 30.
Just make it work for whatever
object you're using and the color
you're using, because it's not
really something that can be.
Be A one size fit all.
And instead of dragging that new
shadow onto the right layer, if you
have a lot of layers, you can just
select the apple on the layer list
and then simply copy and paste it
again and then drag it one level
down.
And as you can see now, that
shadow is in the right place
because it's in the same
direction and it kind of assumes
that the sun or the light is in
the top left corner.
And we want that consistency
for most of the objects
or most of the elements.
That shopping bag is fine because
it's actually standing
on something, but all the floating
elements should have a shadow
that looks pretty natural.
So with this simple technique,
we created a leaf, which is
another decorative element
and a nice looking shadow for it.
But always creating these elements,
you need to be able to zoom in and see
how precise they are because we
don't want any artifacts in it.
Even a couple of pixels
in the wrong color are gonna break
the overall experience.
So as you can see, this little part
here doesn't look quite right.
And you can just upgrade it by
modifying the mask within the shape.
It's likely that you don't need to
modify that same shape for the shadow
because it's blurred anyway.
But for the main leaf or for the main
element, it's actually good to fix
this little inconsistencies because.
Because actually, even if we don't
see them consciously,
we might subconsciously feel something
is wrong with the image and we
don't want that effect to happen.
So using photographic cutout from
the background elements is one way
of making nice high fidelity designs
look more natural and more unique.
But of course there are many more ways
and we're gonna explore them all.
So let's get to the next one.
For this I'm gonna leave some of
the images, but I'm gonna remove
some of them as well, because as
we discussed in this course
previously, having too many
visual elements is actually bad
for the design.
So always be willing to sacrifice some
of those high fidelity elements to
actually benefit the end experience.
Okay, we need a little bit more space.
So I'm going to move the text down
and I'm going to make our, shape in
the background a little bit smaller.
And then you can of course move
the objects a little bit as
well too, have some space.
And we're gonna use that space
for something that has been
trending for a while now,
which is using emojis in apps.
So I duplicated the text field,
the larger text, and then using
the native OS wide emoji picker, I'm
gonna pick the waving hand
and then make it a little bit bigger.
And in some cases it may render
weird, but it should be pretty okay.
And then simply place it above
the welcome message, because
it kind of adds this little bit
of emotional context to it,
like waving hand and welcome.
You know, they go hand in hand.
And that's all pun intended.
And once you have this element, you
can actually make it look even better.
And for the first thing,
I'm going to actually change
the name of the element.
And then I duplicated it.
So we have two of these hands, one
under the other, and select the one at
the bottom and add a layer blur to it.
And of course, increase
the value of the layer blur.
So I'm going to go with 20,
and then either move that shadow
down or move that hand up.
And if you're on a white background
like this, this little blur
is gonna make the emoji instantly
stand out and look better.
Of course, it's completely unnecessary.
You can go with just
the emoji if you prefer.
This emoji can be used on a couple of
screens only, so you shouldn't really
use it in lists or detail pages.
It can be used on dashboards,
onboarding, and login screens because
it can make them seem more friendly.
Okay, now let's duplicate that screen.
And this is going to be one
example where we're going
to create a completely different
style of screen to show you a couple
of different patterns.
I'm going to create a different brand
just for this one screen, and it's
going to be a gaming store.
So I renamed it for now
to PC Store, but probably I'm going
to change the name
to something a little bit better.
And let's start by removing all
of the objects from the the top.
Because if it's a, store with video
games or computer games, we don't
really need vegetables and leaves.
And also let's change the color scheme.
So I'm gonna go with a very dark
background for the entire frame.
But always make sure that
this background is in the hue
that you want to use.
So I'm gonna go with
like, very dark purple.
And then I'm gonna change the same
color to a very similar hue
for our main image on the top,
which is the background.
Just make sure that if you
had a gradient there,
then use a gradient still as well.
And now the next step is to
change the font saturation or the font
hue a little bit towards
that color and make it lighter.
And always modify the text.
So if you Create a new screen
out of another screen.
Always make sure that it doesn't say
organic store or organic vegetables
next to video games, because
that's gonna just look silly.
And the second button is going
to be white and then the first button
is not going to be purple or pink.
I'm going to go with a shade
of blue because I want this button
to stand out from the background.
Especially on a darker background.
It's much easier to notice
a button that's not the same color
as the main visual element.
And of course modify the shadow
to match that color as well.
Always make sure to check the shadow
whether it actually has has the right
color in it, especially if you
duplicate it from a previously created
screen with different color schemes.
So a lot of these things are important.
But okay, we have ourselves a couple of
objects here and now let's make
it look more like a gaming store.
So I'm gonna start with one thing.
The shadow under the emoji.
Because it was on a white
background, it didn't look that bad.
But on a dark background that yellow
actually stands out too much.
So I decreased the opacity
and now I'm gonna remove the roundness
from the corners of our main shape.
And of course to make it more
edgy or more computer gamey,
you can rotate it as well.
And I'm gonna place it here.
And as you can see, you can always
drag it towards the left
corner or fill it fully.
But it actually is pretty interesting
if there are gaps like the one
in the top left corner and you can
create a couple of additional
smaller shapes or smaller lines.
They can be overlapping like
this, or they can be simply
placed a little bit apart.
So there is a lot of things
that you can do with just
a couple of simple shapes.
You can round them, you can
place them on both sides
of the emoji, for example.
So there's like a lot of different
configurations here.
And I prefer to play with
the backgrounds first before I start
adding the actual key visuals.
Because when you add the key visuals,
you might realize that parts
of that background are unnecessary.
But before you do it, you
don't really know that.
So it's more of an experiment.
And some of these background
experiments can actually yield very
surprising and nice looking results.
What we are looking for is variety.
So we have a couple of lines here.
One is very thick, the main line,
and then two are a little bit
thinner and one is a lot thinner.
And they are distributed pretty evenly
with some gaps in them and pretty
even spacing from, from each other.
What you can also try, if you want to
go with just one visual and mostly
rely on the background being the more
visual thing, you can always duplicate
that shape and then change it to a
solid white color or a solid black
color with a, small overlay, so, like,
maybe 5 or 10% opacity, and then
simply overlay it on top of that shape
that we created with a couple of
different sizes to create some
additional pieces, patterns.
Backgrounds like this work well
or quite well if you have one
larger image in the center.
But if you prefer to have a couple
more images, they might be
too complex, so it might be better
to actually remove them.
Okay, now I'm gonna switch
into a 3D library, which
is a separate Figma file.
And for the sake of this
exercise, I'm gonna show you some
free objects from kagwall.
And you can download them,
of course, from the link that you
can see under the artboards.
But there are so many different
libraries like that that you can use.
There is just plenty to choose from.
And as you can see, they are
rendered from different angles.
And it's really good that if you're
gonna use a couple of images
to always keep the same angle.
So don't use images that are rotated
towards different directions.
So I'm gonna pick one of the icons,
maybe that gameboy here, because it
still represents gaming, then go
back to my main object, and I'm
gonna change it to just, Game
Store, because obviously it's not
gonna be a PC.
And after that little tweak to the text
is done, I'm gonna simply paste
the Game Boy onto the artboard.
And it's, of course, a little
bit big, but that's good because
that's gonna keep the quality.
I'm gonna position it in the middle
of the artboard, make it smaller,
and, yes, you can rotate it a little
bit, but just make sure, sure
that the light sources all match up.
So in my case, the light source
right now is coming from the top.
Right.
And we should all match
up the elements the same way.
And of course, you can always blur
the object and add a drop shadow
just coming from that to it,
which is one way of actually
making this depth effect looking good.
This is a very quick exercise,
so I'm not gonna pick the best
possible images or place them
in the best possible position.
I just want to show you how
you can use 3D elements.
And of course, since it's gonna be a
little bit too busy, I'm gonna
remove some of the lines from the
background now from the 3D library,
I'm gonna paste in a heart that's
exactly coming from that same angle
so it has the highlights in the
same space.
And then simply I'm gonna try to
position it somewhere around the
main object, and you can make it
bigger, smaller, and add a little
bit of rotation, but just keeping
the highlights in a similar spot.
And then for some gaming industry news,
I'm gonna paste in a megaphone or
a loudspeaker and just place it on
the right side of that Game Boy here.
Now that you have some objects already
in place, you can start
modifying the background to match
them or fit them or to actually
show them in a, better way.
So one thing that we can do is
to actually drag our background back
onto the focus so we can see one
of the corners or one of the edges.
And using that and some roundness,
we can create an effect
that's gonna be more pronouncing
the middle of the screen.
So, yeah, I'm gonna round
the corners a little bit.
You can try different values
of this, but just to make it different
from the other project that we had,
I'm just gonna keep it
at, like, very little roundness.
And I'm gonna remove one of those
lines that we had as well, because
I want this little asymmetry.
And once you have a general direction
that you like, like this one, you
can then start tweaking the objects
so you can move them into different
positions and see what works better.
You can rotate them a little bit.
You can modify the position entirely,
so you can just drag it from one side
of the screen to the other.
And if you're dragging in a 3D object
that has a screen like a laptop, a
phone, or a Game Boy, you can use the
Path tool to actually recreate the
shape of that screen, like I'm doing
here, just simply tracing it and
then, clicking on, the last dot, and
then you can fill that shape with a
clip color.
And that will allow you
to modify the object.
It's still going to be in 3D, but you
can modify how it looks like.
So I'm going to paste the properties
from the background that
we have here with the gradient.
And of course, it also
pastes the corner radius.
I'm just going to bring it back to
zero, but this looks a little bit
boring because it blends in with the
background too much and kind of shows
that it's like, that Game Boy screen
is transparent and we don't really
want that.
So I'm going to change it
to the blue Button color with a little
bit of the drop shadow there.
But you can remove that drop
shadow, duplicate the object,
and add a layer of blur to it
for a little glowing effect.
And of course you can experiment
with different colors here
or a gradient, or even adding
an image there if you can.
And if you have a blurred version
of that screen in the background, you
can make it larger to actually make
that effect more prominent or increase
the blur or decrease the opacity.
So there's like a ton of options
to modify just this one part
of the image very easily.
And I'm just gonna keep it
at somewhere like this.
But now that we have more objects, I'm
not too convinced about the heart.
I don't think that it just looks good
next to all of the other elements.
So I'm gonna pick a different
one and paste it in.
So since it's gaming, I picked
the arrow and the target and I'm just
gonna place it below the Gameboy here.
And it looks pretty good because
it actually adds a little bit more
effect, effect or depth to it.
And also because it's angled a little
bit differently, yet is still
using the same light source, it adds
some more variety to the screen.
The thing about onboarding screens is
that if you're going to use 3D
images, it's actually very easy to
create some nice looking designs very
quickly because all of those 3D
images you can find for free, and
they are actually making this entire
design into eye candy or something
that draws attention.
But we're gonna come back to it later.
What we want to do now is make
a couple of different versions
of that onboarding screen
with different decorations.
So I'm gonna duplicate the screen
without the emoji
and then I'm gonna remove all
of those images from that screen.
So all of the surrounding images
from the shopping bag and of
course all of the shadows as well.
Now, this is gonna be a super
easy way to actually make
some high fidelity elements.
So I'm gonna group, group the two
emojis that we had, the main one
and the shadow, and then I'm going
to simply pick another emoji that
actually matches the style of the app.
So I'm going to pick some vegetables
basically and of course make sure
that if you add the emoji to the
right space, you also paste that
exact same emoji onto the blurred
shadow layer.
So I'm going to go with the cucumber
and then I'm going to click into the
field again, copy the cucumber, and
then going to go into the shadow
element, because right now it's
yellow.
And then paste that same
cucumber and again into
the blurred shadow and then place
it under the main object.
Then you can make it bigger.
And, of course, emojis look different
in different operating systems,
so it all really depends on what
tool and what OS you're using.
They look pretty good on Mac OS
and iOS, but the new Windows upcoming
emojis are also looking very good.
So for the second one, I'm going to
paste in the avocado and then simply
paste it onto the shadow as well.
If you're gonna go with emojis as
decoration like this, make sure
that they're not the same size.
So, first of all, I'm gonna change
the blur value of one of them, and
also I'm gonna decrease the size of
that top emoji a little bit by
selecting both the shadow and the
main object.
And it can overlap a little bit.
It's not really necessary.
It can be also in the middle.
And then I'm gonna duplicate this again
and add another vegetable, because
we're gonna have probably four of them
just to have, like, an even number.
And normally you don't mix red
and green, but I want to spice
up this design a little bit.
So I'm gonna go with
a spicy chili pepper.
And this pepper actually
looks pretty good.
Also has a, green stem,
so it's gonna fit it.
And when I paste it into the shadow
category or the shadow layer,
as you can see, it has a very nice
blurry red shadow underneath that.
And even though it contrasts a little
bit with the green, it also makes
it look more interesting visually.
So don't use red and green together
unless it's emojis.
And for the last one, I'm gonna
paste in a little bit of corn.
And just to counterbalance it a little
bit, I'm gonna make it a lot smaller
as well, because there's enough
space already taken by those emojis.
And as you can see, I didn't place it
at the exact same level as the pepper
because I want that variety.
And I want it to look semi random,
because that's the more natural look.
And of course, while keeping it
random, we also want it to be
pretty evenly distributed so
we don't have too much empty space.
And also we don't have too
many of these objects
very close to each other.
And the last thing that I'm gonna do
is to actually select the entire
layer with the corn and then rotate
it around, because I want it to
actually be facing the other
direction and of course move the
shadow as well.
So it's more.
We don't want the shadow to be on top
and it actually can be moved a little
bit further down the bottom because
that actually shows that this object
is further away from the background
and it's casting a, longer, larger
shadow.
And as you can see, that's
a very easy way to create some
illustration or some decorative
elements with just emojis.
Okay, now let's try
something different.
Let's work on some photo backgrounds.
So for that I'm going to paste
in the registration
screen because it has some form field,
a button and some text.
And then we're gonna add a photo to it.
So I found a nice looking
organic vegetables photo on unsplash,
that's free to use.
And then I simply pasted it
into the artboard.
And the most obvious way to use
that photo is to just simply
add it to the background
of our entire screen like this.
So kind of drag it down the layer list
and then simply decrease the opacity.
There's also a little white overlay
on the top, so let's remove that.
So many people do something like this.
And the problem with this approach
is that if you don't have the
control of what's in the photo and
if the photo is quite busy like
this one, in most opacity levels,
it just adds a little bit more
complexity to it without really
contributing much.
And if you want the photo
to be visible, it has too little
contrast with the elements.
So basically it makes
the screen unreadable.
So let's make it in a way that is
actually going to work for this photo.
So first I'm gonna drag the form down
a little bit and let's work on showing
this photo in a more prominent way.
I'm gonna start
by creating a large oval.
It can take about half of the screen
and then simply paste it
to the background so it's behind
everything else, kind of like this.
And you don't have to go with
like a circle, you can make it
into an oval so it doesn't
have to be exactly round.
And then I'm gonna paste the image
on top of that and simply
mask it with that new shape.
And as you can see now, we don't have
any obstruction, from the photo coming
towards the form, which is the most
important part of this screen yet.
We do have a high fidelity visual.
Nice looking element on the top.
Okay, let's start by changing
the colors of the elements to white
because we want to add a little
bit more contrast to it.
And also we want to see what we
can do to make the screen work.
So after changing the color to white,
you can instantly see that
the contrast is really bad.
So the text is blending in
with the background too much.
It's very hard to read.
So first I'm gonna start off
by removing some of the objects,
but I'm gonna keep that one leaf
and actually make it overlap
that photo on the top side.
So just above the form, there's
this little extra visual
element that makes it a little
bit more three dimensional.
You can try adding the logo
somewhere here, but I don't
think it's a good idea.
Idea.
Also, that whole object can be
actually a little bit smaller
because there's not enough
stuff to actually add to it.
And we don't want empty space just
for the sake of showing more photos.
So I'm just gonna pull it up a little
bit and then bring the form closer
to it, but just kind of in the middle
of that empty white space.
And one thing that you noticed is
that this little white element here
kind of looks from the distance
like there is a break
in our ellipse in the background.
So always look at things around
the edge like that, that can
look weird and simply fix them.
But we still have a problem of really
bad contrast issues with the text.
So I'm gonna go to one of our screens
that we created before that had
a nice gradient vanishing overlay.
And then I'm gonna go back to this
screen and paste it inside the mask.
And this itself looks pretty
good because you can still see some
of the photo, but there is
better contrast, but you can
still tweak it a little bit.
So, for example, you can make this
whole gradient disappear a lot faster.
So just decrease
the opacity quite a lot.
And that way parts of the photo
will be actually fully visible.
And to make the text more prominent,
you can add a very subtle
drop shadow to the larger text.
Avoid adding drop shadow
to the back arrow or to the small
text because in most cases
it's just going to look messy.
So that part near the top has
to be accessible on its own.
Its own, or it has to have
a dark overlay or a light overlay
on the photo.
And of course, it's tempting
to paste in another leaf and maybe
try something like this, but it
really is too much, trust me.
So if you're gonna go with
a very complex, visually heavy photo,
it's good that you don't overdo it
with the extra elements.
Because it's just gonna look overdone.
It's gonna look
too complicated for our eyes.
Eyes.
So one leaf is more than enough.
And you can tweak the photo as well.
You can rotate the mask, for example,
to create a different, shape.
You can rotate the mask into
the other direction as well.
But just make sure then
to modify the overlapping
element if you have one.
But it's not necessary.
You don't need to have
an overlapping element.
This is just one way of using both
the photo and some cutout photos
with some shadows in your designs.
So you can play with the position
of the element, and you can play
with the actual mask position or mask
rotation, but don't overdo it.
And in some cases, it's actually best
that if you have a form that's on the
left edge of the screen, to avoid
having this empty space on the left
edge, it just simply flows a little
bit better.
If that empty space is
on the right, it makes the form
flow a little bit better.
And also the F pattern
and scanning along the left edge
is simply a lot easier.
Okay, let's duplicate another one
of these onboarding screens, and let's
create yet another version.
For this, I'm gonna pick the one
with the emoji, and then I'm
gonna remove all of the emoji.
So what we want to do here is
actually try some even simpler
shapes that you can create
yourself in the design tool.
So I'm gonna go into our
playgrounds where we created those
shiny balls around the main object
using inner circles shadows, and
I'm gonna pick the white ones
because they might blend in a
little bit better.
But of course, you can create
new ones in the right color
that your app already has.
And what I'm gonna do is gonna
place those balls around the main
object, which is the,
circular background, the green one.
And I'm gonna duplicate them.
So there's four of them, and they
are roughly around the center,
but they're overlapping differently,
and they are at different places.
But basically.
So we don't want it to look like
they were deliberately placed there,
but instead, we want it to look
like they're floating in space.
And that, actually, you can
create an animation in which
they simply move into that space.
And for some of them, I'm going
to move them under our main object
in the layer list, and two
of them I'm going to keep on top.
And for this, we're going
to use the glass morphism effect.
So, first of all, make sure that
the layer which Says pass through
has 100% opacity and then decrease
the opacity of just the fill.
So I went to 60%.
And then in the effects panel, I'm
gonna go with a background blur
and then select the right value.
So those balls
in the background are blurry.
And you can modify the colors
a little bit to make it darker,
more visible, just play around.
Because this effect mostly works
with lighter colors on lighter colors,
but it doesn't really specify that you
need to have those color combinations.
So.
So you can go with green,
slightly transparent green
on a white background, and this
can still look pretty good.
So what we want now is for those balls
on top of that to cast a shadow
onto the green background.
So I'm gonna simply make a new oval
and I'm gonna fill it with the same
color as the background and then
decrease the brightness by 10.
And then simply go to do a layer
blur and place it in the right
position, move it under the
main O object, and you can also
modify the size of it a little
bit.
So just make it look like the shadow is
just being cast by the ball onto that
background, but only very slightly.
And of course, you can increase
the layer blur as well.
We don't want this effect
to be too strong.
It has to be more
of a subconscious thing.
And once you have a shadow that you
like, you can duplicate it and move
it, of course, a smaller version of it
onto the other overlapping ball.
And of course, yeah, make it
smaller, just move it into place.
And this is one of those scenarios
where you can have one of those
shadows actually be cast from the top,
because this is a slightly different
and less realistic approach.
But of course, normally it would be
better if the ball at the bottom
actually cast the shadow downwards.
And this is especially true
with strong shadows.
But, okay, let's duplicate the screen
again and make a dark version of it.
So this dark version will have a dark
background coming from our main
dark green, gray, and also decreased
brightness of that color as well.
So it's almost black, but not quite.
And for this element, you can play
around with different opacity
levels, different blur values.
Just play around until it looks good.
One thing that's often being done
with glassmorphic elements is
to actually have the gradient in
the background with, reduced opacity
on one end almost down to zero.
So it's like a very low value.
And that will create this glass effect
into something that is even
more visible or more prominent.
And if you increase the layer
blur, it's gonna look
more like a frosted glass.
And of course, the next step is
to make the text visible.
So I'm just gonna change it
to white, and then for the other text,
just decrease the opacity.
So.
So it's a quick and dirty trick to
have the text match the background.
Okay, let's duplicate this screen
again and make a, more classic
dark mode glass morphism card,
because this is something that's
actually quite popular and it can look
pretty good in onboarding.
It can also look pretty good
in some apps inside the apps as well.
So you can try it if it fits
your app, but things like that.
Effects like that work best if your
app doesn't have a lot of screens.
And it's pretty simple overall.
So what I'm gonna do here is
create a new card background, which
is gonna be a new rectangle.
And this is a very handy trick to
paste something onto the right layer.
I simply clicked on that green
background and then pasted
the rectangle that I just created.
Of course, let's round the corners
a little bit so it matches
the one in the background.
And then the next step would be
to remove the background element.
But first copy the properties, remove
it, and then paste the properties
onto the newly created rectangle.
And of course, of course it
messed up the corner radius.
So I'm gonna bring it back
and 24 should be enough.
Okay.
But for this card, I want it to be a
true glassmorphism, and it has a
couple of particular effects there
that needed, to be applied for it
to look like a real glassmorphic
card.
So first of all, I'm gonna decrease
the brightness of both ends
of the gradient and then change it
into a radial gradient.
And then the idea is this.
The starting point of the gradient,
which is inside
of the radial gradient, gradient
should be a little bit lighter
and a little bit more opaque.
And then the edge of it should
be a little bit darker and a little
bit more transparent.
And of course, you can
tweak it to your liking.
You can make it a little bit diagonal
to make it look a little bit
more natural and less generic, or
it can just go straight down.
How this effect looks really depends
on what's behind the glass and also
what kind of background you're using.
So many different factors contribute
to this, and once you're happy
with this, you can then
modify those balls a little bit.
And also, if we're using dark mode
like this, we don't really need
those shadows anymore, because
especially with dark mode,
shadows add a little bit of an
extra complexity that's not
really necessary.
So I'm rearranging the background
elements to make this whole scene
look a little bit more interesting
and to show that this is
the first step of a scrolling group.
I'm going to duplicate this card
and place it near
the edge of the screen.
And then I'm gonna press enter and then
decrease the corner radius down to
zero of the two points near the edge.
And I'm doing it this way and just
making it smaller for one reason,
because if you go with a, background
blur and the object is actually
sticking outside of the screen, which
is basically overlapping the screen,
then there is gonna be a weird white
line on the edge of it.
So to avoid it, better have the card
that still within the boundaries
but sticking out be exactly the size
that's remaining on the screen.
And I'm gonna make it a little bit
darker so it's barely visible, but you
subconsciously notice it's there
and then you know that you can scroll.
Okay.
While I kinda like the effect of those
balls under the glass being blurred
this way and kind of being spread
with the blur, let's add a little bit
of more natural feel to.
So I'm just gonna duplicate
that ball, remove all
of the effects from it and change
the color to a darker shade.
And I just picked the darker shade
from the background here.
So let's add a layer blur
to it and let's change the value
to something larger.
I'm gonna go with 30, but you can go
with a larger value for sure as well.
And the idea is that we want that card
to actually cast
a little bit of a shadow.
And also it masks a little bit
of that ball behind the card so it
doesn't look like it's weird glowing
overlay from underneath.
You can play around with the opacity
of your newly created object to
tweak it a little bit so you can
actually decrease the opacity, you
can increase it, you can move it to
the second ball near the top to
achieve the same effect on the other
edge as well.
The idea is that we don't really
want that blur to be too strong.
So you can tweak the opacity like this
and that kind of mutes
the blurred background a little bit
bit, but it's still there.
And that adds a more
natural effect to the card.
But of course, if you liked
the previous version with like
a fully visible blurred
background, that's also fine.
So it's all about finding something
that you like and then exploring
what else can you do with it.
And once those Two balls
behind the glass are more
out of the way visually.
You can also increase the size
of the two in front.
And for example, you can add an emoji
to one of the them because
it's not really a ball anymore,
it's more like a white circle.
So you can add an emoji, make
it a little bit smaller.
But what I really like is,
when sometimes these emojis
overlap a little bit.
But we want it like in this case,
the stem to overlap, but we don't
want it to be just on the edge.
For the second one, I'm going
to grab an avocado and then
simply move it into place.
And of course we need it smaller,
so just select both the fonts
and then make it smaller.
And, and if you made one of them
overlap, you don't need to have
both of them work the same way.
What I'm starting to notice a lot
more right now in UI design and in
high fidelity design is that if
things look too generic or too
similar or too pre made, then it's
actually gonna make the design
look boring.
So if one overlaps
the other one shouldn't.
And just play around with
different options until you
find something that you.
And of course you can also decrease
the opacity of the gradient, play
around with the colors a little
bit more, make it darker, lighter.
Just make sure that the changes that
you're doing, especially to brightness
and transparency, are not too big.
So go into either direction by maybe 10
or 20 points, but don't go too far.
What we can also do is add a little
border to the shape, make sure that
it's inside the shape, and then make
it a little bit darker, for example,
because that's a pretty unusual
approach.
And I'm gonna go with like one point
and then decrease the opacity of that
border and that's gonna make the edge
instantly look a little bit different.
And for the border, you can make it
thicker or you can make it lighter,
for example, or you can make a
gradient that's vanishing from a fully
white background on the border on the
top to completely transparent border
on the bottom.
And once you have a style that you
like, like in this case, I'm
gonna paste it into that overlapping
card in the background as well.
But just to make it a little bit
better, I'm gonna modify the gradient
or you can just simply switch it
to a, solid color fill
with the proper transparency.
But it's gonna keep the nice
border and it's gonna keep
the proper transparency
and background blur values.
That we found.
So doing those designs, as you can
see, is a lot about tweaking,
because we want to be sure that
something looks good against a
particular background or with
certain images and with certain
shadow or blur values.
So just play around and see what works.
And it takes a while, but this is
good because this is the part of
the creative process that actually
lets you be fully creative and go
beyond the generic UI elements that
we all have to use for the app to
be usable.
So in a short time, we created eight
completely distinct screens made
with a couple of different techniques.
But, of course, there is
still a lot more to try.
A good way to approach this is to do
your research and find apps that
are using some cool techniques on
their onboarding screens and then
try to replicate them, because many
of these apps are gonna be using
variations of these techniques with
a twist.
So you need to find that twist
and add something from yourself
to it to make it unique.
Okay, let's duplicate that screen
again and make one more version.
And for this version, as
a decoration, I'm gonna go with
the simplest possible shapes.
So I'm gonna create a circle,
a square, a square with some rounded
corners, and then a triangle.
And I'm gonna make them all white
because we have a white background,
and I don't want those shapes
to be too overwhelming visually.
So now the idea is to make them
roughly the same size in terms
of their scale and also add
a little bit of a shadow to them.
And normally, I would suggest
picking a green color, making
the brightness a little bit lower,
and using that shadow with
a slightly larger blur value.
But I'm gonna show you why this
might not always be the best case.
So I duplicated one of the elements,
rotated it a little bit, and made it
overlap the background at the top.
Now, let's move these shapes around
so I move the triangle out of view.
And as you can see, that green shadow
looks very weird on the background.
So I'm gonna decrease the actual
saturation to it for it to be
completely gray, and then increase
the blue blur, because in some
backgrounds, the shadow doesn't
really have to be colorful,
especially if there's a white
background and that's a white
object that casting the shadow.
And same with a black
background and a black object.
So play around with the shadow values,
the blur values, and the colors,
and then, simply move those
objects around the image like we did
with the vegetables before.
And, yeah, I'm gonna select
them all and gonna decrease.
Increase the saturation
quite significantly.
But as you can see, that
Might not even be enough.
So I'm just gonna move one
of the objects there and then
the other one to the top.
It can overlap a little bit or it
can be even completely outside.
Make the circle larger, like this.
Rotate the triangle.
We want it to look a little bit
chaotic, but also pretty
distributed as with the vegetables.
And as you can see, if something
is casting the shadow onto the white
background background,
even a slightest amount of saturation
is still gonna make it look weird.
So instead I'm just gonna decrease
the saturation, increase the blur.
And, you can also decrease
the transparency of the element.
And if you want, you can add
a layer blur to one of the objects
to create the bokeh effect.
If you like this particular style,
just make sure that if you go
with the bokeh, just use it
on one or two elements only.
Don't do it to most of them
because it's gonna look messy.
But if most of them are
in focus and maybe one or two aren't,
it can look pretty cool.
And that allows you to have
a semi 3D effect by just using
simple 2D vector shapes.
And the last thing that I want to
do here is to modify the shadows
a little bit and the corner
radius for some of the elements
because I believe that some of
them still look a little bit too
strong.
So I'm gonna decrease the opacity
and then just play around with
the opacity of that shadow for,
for the circle at the bottom.
So, yeah, if this is smaller, it just
looks a lot better, a lot more subtle.
Okay, now let's try
something even different.
So I'm going to duplicate one of
the screens again and then we're
going to play around with the
background positioning because
obviously the background doesn't
have to be a, very rounded, pill
shaped rectangle coming from the
edge of the screen.
Most of the apps nowadays use
a background that's actually
a full width element that is
rounded near the bottom edge.
So something a little bit like this,
and if you like it, you can
actually use that particular
shape or that particular roundness.
I'm making my shape a little bit
wider so there is no white background
peeking through on the sides.
And once I'm happy with the actual
size, then you can modify
the corner radius again.
So for example, you can go
to something a little bit.
It can be still a rounded rectangle,
but the roundness, for example,
can be as round as the top edge
of a mock up that you plan
to actually put the screen in.
And this can look very good.
So it's really important
to actually plan ahead.
And if you're making screens just
for the sake of a visual portfolio,
then you can leave it like that.
You can also duplicate that shape
at the bottom and simply have
like an overlay for the buttons.
But I would suggest to go with
something completely different.
So instead of the color that we
had there, I'm gonna copy the style
out of that barely visible
black and white semi transparent
gradient that we had before.
And then of course you can modify
it so it's more visible still.
So I'm just gonna drag one
of the handles up and modify
the position of both edges
of it until it's visible.
And of course it can also
fade down to full transparency
to towards the bottom.
And of course bring back
the corner radius because
it changed when we pasted the style.
And of course, if you go with
something like this, those little
indicators should be moved between
the edge of the newly created shape
in the background and the buttons
like this, because we don't want them
to be on the line.
And you can play around with different
versions or different opacity levels.
But if you go with an object like
this, I would always prefer
to keep it subtle so it doesn't
overtake the buttons or the text.
Or you can move it up towards the top
and simply go the other
way around with the background.
So, for example, you can remove
the top background, the green
one, and then simply reassemble all
of the shapes again.
So the background can be just under
the text and the white background
can be under the photos.
And this is another way of creating
a high fidelity image that's pretty
minimal and also looks a lot different
than the rest the of rest of them.
Okay, now let's duplicate
the screen and let's try
something completely crazy.
So I'm gonna do a version
of this with Neuomorphism.
And if you're thinking that
neuomorphism has terrible
accessibility, you're probably right.
But it doesn't matter as long
as that neuomorphic element
is only limited to decoration.
And this is what we're gonna be doing.
So I changed the background color
to a desaturated green.
That's pretty light, but still visible,
because for neomorphism we need
a white shadow and a dark shadow
to be visible on the background.
So the background cannot
be white or black.
So I'm gonna create a circle
and then simply move it
to the center of our image.
And the idea for Neomorphism is
that this circle will have
the same background color as the main
background on the screen.
So if I Use the color picker to do it.
It disappears.
But this is what we, we want.
Then we add two drop shadows to it.
One is going to be the darker shadow
and one is gonna be lighter.
So for the X and Y value, I'm gonna go
with 8 and a blur of 16.
Then in the second drop shadow,
use the same value but negative
for both X and Y and of course
a blur of 16 and change the color
of that shadow to white.
And if it's not really fully
visible, just make sure that
you have proper opacity.
So for the white shadow, it actually
can be pretty high above 60%.
And this little background works
quite well if you have
overlapping elements on top of it.
So I'm going to readjust some
of the objects and also
the background itself.
And if you're not too happy
with the shadows, you
can still modify them.
So first of all, I'm just going
to pick a more greener hue for
the shadow on the darker edge
of the new morphic circle.
And if you pick just the right color,
it's going to be a subtle effect
like this with which is cool.
It actually is cool.
And you can still use an effect
like this in some of the designs.
Just make sure that you don't
use this effect on buttons,
for example, because it simply
doesn't work on elements that
need the higher contrast.
So even that forbidden style
can be used successfully
to create a nice looking interface.
And what I'm going to do now is going
to be pretty controversial because
I'm going to copy the style and paste
it onto the secondary button.
And as you can see,
see it's barely visible.
I'm going to increase the corner
radius so it's rounded as well.
And yes, this looks pretty nice,
but that button is not accessible.
But at the same time, the text
on the button, which is
the secondary text, is really dark
against that background.
So for people who can't see
the edge of that shadow, it's going
to be completely fine.
They're going to be still able to click
on that button because they're going
to see it as a simple text link.
The biggest problem with Neomorphism, I
believe, was people using this effect
on every single element on the screen.
This is wrong.
This effect has a place in UI design,
but only if it's used for decoration
or very non important elements that
are otherwise accessible anyway.
So there shouldn't be any forbidden
elements or design trends.
Experiment with everything.
Because to truly grow as a designer,
you need variety and you need
to try different styles every time
you can't have all your apps
looking exactly the same.
As you can see, we're still missing
one screen in this process.
So I'm just gonna duplicate one
of the minimal ones
and then move it into place.
And what we're gonna do here is
an Aurora style background.
So first I'm gonna remove
the background from the bottom
and then create a circle.
And for that circle, I'm gonna
pick a very light color
from the background that we had.
So I picked the one from the background
of the secondary button
and then go to Layer Blur and pick
a pretty large blur value.
So I'm gonna go with 100.
Now I'm gonna move that circle
to the very bottom of the layer list
so it's below everything else.
And now I'm gonna duplicate it
and move it to the right side.
But for this right circle,
I'm gonna change the color.
And you can try mixing
different colors together.
So you can try blue and green, and then
you can try to duplicate that circle
again and move it towards the center
and add another color to it.
And usually it's really best if
you keep a similar color palette.
But for the very first one, I tried
to show you that it can actually
be a couple of different colors
if they merge well together.
But since my app has a pretty specific
color scheme, I'm gonna modify
this color a little bit as well.
So, first of all, I'm gonna increase
the saturation and the brightness,
but decrease the transparency and then
move it more towards the green.
Or in my case, if I already have
an orange object, the carrot on
that background, I can move it
towards the yellow hue, because
that's gonna make it blend in
with that object in the
background better.
And then you can modify this
object as well, the bigger circle,
to be a little bit more orange.
And that creates that nice
blurry, kind of dirty look.
But at the same time, it kind
of adds a little bit of uniqueness
to this whole design.
And as you can see, this little shape
with the three circles look pretty
similar to a pop culture icon.
And of course, they don't
have to be the same.
You can actually make them
different sizes and slightly
different positions, so it doesn't
have to be uniform.
The whole appeal of this effect
is that it looks pretty organic.
So don't be too confined
by where those blurred circles are.
Play around with their
position and their size.
The most important thing is that
they need to overlap a little
bit, because otherwise this kind
of transition between the two
different gradients won't occur.
And of course, it's easier to go
with decorations on the onboarding
screens, but some of these
effects you can actually use
on most of the other screen.
So you can try an Aurora,
background behind your card layouts
or anything else that is
actually useful in the app.
Just don't overdo it and make sure that
the app elements that you're going
to use, the buttons, the form fields
and so on, are the most visible,
the most contrasting on the screen.
And then play around
with the decoration.
And now once you know how to apply
these effects, you'll be able to
easier actually replicate things that
you like online and add a little bit
of your own nice touch to it.
And this is the whole goal to look for
inspiration and then try to copy it
and add something from yourself to it.
Don't copy it directly unless
it's a practice exercise.
This process is a lot of fun and try
to explore different opportunities
and different concepts all the time.
Even if you find a style that
you like quite a lot, don't confine
yourself within the boundaries
of that one style forever.
Experiment with different options,
objects, different modes.
So make a dark mode app, make a
glass morphism up, make a new
morphism up just for the sake of
practicing all of those different
techniques and being able to
actually come up with new ideas
on the fly.
Because in the end it's all
about merging these techniques
into something truly
yours and truly original.
Hey, so our adventure
has come to an end.
But don't worry, there's
still a little bit to be done
with the project project.
So let's start by going into
the plugins and in Sketch and Adobe
xd, you'll have to just find them
manually in any case and in any tool.
What we're looking for
is a contrast checker.
So I'm gonna search for contrast
and I'm gonna pick the one
from Microsoft because I
believe that's gonna be probably
the one that works best.
But just in case, I'm gonna
install two of them and then let's
go back into our project.
There are also many web based plugins,
completely free, that you can actually
simply paste the hex codes for two col
how contrasting they are against each
other and that works fine as well.
What we're aiming for is double A.
So for example, in this case all
the fonts are simply easy to read.
This is what we're aiming for.
We don't really need to do AAA
for everything because most OSs
actually have an option to bump up
the contrast of everything in the os.
So people that need that AAA
contrast can actually set it
up so it works for them.
But as you can see, our green button
doesn't quite work because
it doesn't even pass the AA version.
I'm gonna check it
again just to be sure.
But yeah, doesn't work.
So what we need to do is to modify
the color and you can actually
modify it right within the plugin,
which is very handy until
the AA option is checked out.
And we don't want that contrast to be
so high that it's gonna hurt our eyes.
So I'm just gonna set it up
so it barely checks the AA because
that's enough and it should work.
And then what you can do is simply
select that hex code and then
paste it onto the other buttons
so they're going to pass
accessibility checks as well.
The only objects that you need
to test this way are buttons,
main text of the app and form
fields, and everything that is
actually something that people
can use on the screen.
So you don't need to check the card
backgrounds or the decoration.
The most important thing is that all
of the usable actual
interface elements are accessible.
If you got the course with
feedback, it's really important that
you prepare the screens
for the feedback in the right way.
What I'm looking for is at least
six completely different screens
from the entire process.
So it doesn't matter which screens
you choose, but it's important
for them to be completely different.
So I don't want to see two versions of
only onboarding one version, the one
that you believe is best is enough.
But then show the cart, view
the shopping cart, or anything else.
It needs to be six
different screens or more.
If you plan to use this design
in your portfolio.
Of course, make a lot more
screens than just six.
But those six are gonna be
the base for my evaluation.
So I'm gonna paste in a detail
screen and just to make them
consistent, I'm gonna also copy
that blurry Aurora background that
I made and then paste it onto this
new screen and then remove, remove
that background that was there
previously.
And this also fits the style.
So of course you need
to tweak it for accessibility.
For example, the price tag here is
not accessible, so make sure
to modify things like that so they're
consistent, accessible and look good.
A lot of the high fidelity designing
is exploration and going pretty
fast because you get ideas and you
need to act upon them quickly.
So a lot of these things that
you created can be inconsistent.
So there could be a back arrow
missing on some of the screens.
So make sure to Paste it in and then
move it into the right place.
But because of that fast pace,
that icon is also too thick
and has the wrong color.
And all of these icons actually
have different colors.
So we need to modify it so
they all are matching.
And once you establish the right border
thickness and the right color for most
of the icons, make sure that all
of your screens are consistent.
So, for example, this icon here is
still not consistent with the colors.
So it's really good to actually change.
If you know how to use components,
you can do it that way, but you
can also just copy properties and then
paste them onto every object.
For beginners, it's actually good
to do it this way because that
makes you remember that you need
to manually check every
single thing on every screen.
So we need that internal
consistency, same border radiuses
for similar items.
So if you have some buttons
that are not rounded, it's best
to actually round the them.
If you have some contrast
issues, that's the same thing.
So just make sure that everything
is consistent and everything
looks well together.
It's important to remember,
though, that not all
the screens need the decoration.
So make sure that you don't put those
floating images or floating
shapes or 3D images or 3D objects
onto every single screen.
For example, the product screen, which
is the second one from the left, left,
doesn't have any extra decoration
because it's an important screen.
This is the screen that you'll
see just before you add something
to your shopping bag, which is
very important for E commerce.
So we don't really want to overwhelm
the users with visual, and we want
them to be able to make the decision
very quickly without distractions.
Okay, this is it.
Hope you enjoyed the course and hope
that you learned the techniques that
you can then use to replicate and be
inspired from different sources.
Sources and create your own unique
style for every separate
project that you're working on.
We gave you the building blocks and
the initial tools, but of course,
all of it is now in your hands and
it requires you to put in a lot of
extra work and a lot of extra
time.
But now that you have the tools,
it should be a lot easier.
Good luck.
And remember, high fidelity UI design
is very important to sell your work.
