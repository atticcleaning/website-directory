## 7. Writing Template & Quality Guidelines

### 7.1 Target Word Count

Each article should be **800-1,200 words**. Aim for thorough but focused content — long enough to provide real value, short enough to maintain reader attention.

### 7.2 Required MDX Components

Every article **must** include these two components:

1. **`<CityStats city="[slug]" />`** — Place in the introductory section after the first inline city link. Uses the first city from `relatedCities`. This is an async React Server Component that queries Prisma for live city data (listing count, average rating, service type distribution).

2. **`<FindPros service="[service]" />`** — Place as the closing CTA, after the final content section. Optionally include a `query` prop for service-specific searches.

### 7.3 Internal Linking Requirements

- **Minimum 2 inline city page links** per article using markdown link syntax: `[City Name](/city-slug)`. Use cities from the article's `relatedCities` array.
- **Reference related articles** where natural — link to articles in the same topicTag or that cover complementary topics. Do not force links; only include when contextually relevant.
- **No external links** — all links should be internal to the directory site.

### 7.4 SEO Structure

**Frontmatter (required fields):**

```yaml
title: "Article Title Here"
slug: "article-slug-here"
excerpt: "1-2 sentence description for meta + ArticleCard display."
topicTag: "Category Name"
publishedAt: "2026-MM-DD"
relatedCities:
  - city-slug-1
  - city-slug-2
  - city-slug-3
```

**Heading structure:**
- Article title (`title` field) serves as the page `<h1>` (rendered by the page template)
- Use **`## H2`** sections for major topics — each article should have 3-6 H2 sections
- H2s should contain keywords naturally (not stuffed)
- Use `###` sparingly for subsections within an H2

**Title optimization:**
- Phrase titles as search queries homeowners would type
- Include the primary keyword near the beginning
- Keep under 60 characters when possible for SERP display

### 7.5 Tone and Voice

- **Authoritative but accessible** — write as a knowledgeable professional speaking to a homeowner, not as an academic
- **Homeowner-focused** — address the reader directly ("your attic", "you should")
- **Actionable advice** — every section should give the reader something they can do or decide
- **Honest about limitations** — acknowledge when professional help is needed rather than overselling DIY
- **No sales language** — inform, don't pitch. The `<FindPros>` CTA handles conversion.

### 7.6 Content Formatting Patterns

**Intro paragraph pattern:**
```mdx
Intro sentence with inline city link [City Name](/city-slug). More context about the topic.
<CityStats city="city-slug" />
```

**Section pattern:**
```mdx
## H2 Section Title

Body text with actionable advice. May include:
- Bullet lists for tips or signs
- Numbered lists for sequential steps
- Blockquotes for expert advice or key takeaways
- Inline links to city pages: [Houston](/houston-tx)
```

**Closing CTA pattern:**
```mdx
<FindPros service="attic cleaning" />
```

Or with a service-specific query:
```mdx
<FindPros service="attic insulation removal" query="insulation removal" />
```

### 7.7 Example Article Structure

```mdx
---
title: "Complete Guide to Attic Rodent Cleanup"
slug: "rodent-cleanup-guide"
excerpt: "A comprehensive guide to professional attic rodent cleanup..."
