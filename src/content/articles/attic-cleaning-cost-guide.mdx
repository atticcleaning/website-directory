How much should you expect to pay for professional attic cleaning? The answer depends on what kind of work your attic actually needs. A basic debris removal runs a fraction of what a full insulation replacement with rodent remediation costs, and prices vary significantly by region, attic size, and the severity of any contamination. In competitive markets like [Los Angeles](/los-angeles-ca), where dozens of companies offer attic services, understanding these variables puts you in a stronger position when comparing quotes and budgeting for the project.

## Cost by Service Type

Attic cleaning isn't a single service — it's a category that covers several distinct types of work. Each carries its own price range based on the labor, equipment, and materials involved.

| Service Type | Typical Cost Range | What's Included |
|---|---|---|
| Basic attic cleanout | $200–$600 | Removal of debris, old belongings, and light dust. No insulation work. |
| Insulation removal only | $1,000–$2,500 | Vacuuming out old blown-in or batt insulation with industrial equipment. |
| Insulation removal + replacement | $1,500–$4,500 | Full removal of old insulation, air sealing, and installation of new material to current R-value standards. |
| Rodent cleanup and restoration | $1,500–$5,000 | Contaminated insulation removal, sanitization, decontamination, exclusion work, and re-insulation. |
| Mold remediation | $1,500–$6,000+ | Containment, mold removal from wood surfaces, antimicrobial treatment, and source correction. |
| Comprehensive attic restoration | $3,000–$8,000+ | Combines multiple services — insulation, pest remediation, sanitization, air sealing, and new insulation. |

Most homeowners in [Los Angeles](/los-angeles-ca) and other major metros spend between $1,500 and $4,000 for a full attic cleaning that includes insulation replacement. For a detailed walkthrough of what each step involves, see our guide on [the professional attic cleaning process](/articles/professional-attic-cleaning-process).

## Factors That Affect Pricing

Several variables determine where your project falls within these ranges.

**Attic size** is the most straightforward factor. A 500-square-foot attic costs less to clean than a 2,000-square-foot space simply because there's less material to remove and less area to treat. Most companies price insulation removal and replacement by the square foot, typically $1.00 to $2.50 per square foot for removal and $1.50 to $3.00 per square foot for new blown-in insulation.

**Accessibility** matters more than homeowners realize. Attics with tight access hatches, low roof pitches, or obstructed pathways take longer to work in and may require additional labor. Walk-up attics with standing height are the easiest and least expensive to service.

**Contamination level** drives the biggest cost differences. A clean attic that simply needs an insulation upgrade is far less expensive than one contaminated with rodent waste, mold, or water damage. Contaminated attics require sanitization, decontamination, and sometimes structural treatment that adds $500 to $2,000 or more to the base price.

**Geographic location** also plays a role. Labor rates, disposal fees, and demand vary by market. In [Houston](/houston-tx), where rodent activity is a year-round concern and attic cleaning is in constant demand, prices tend to be competitive due to the number of providers. In [Denver](/denver-co), where extreme temperature swings make insulation quality critical, homeowners may pay a premium for energy-focused services.

## What's Included in a Typical Quote

When you receive a quote for attic cleaning, it should clearly itemize what's covered. A thorough estimate includes:

- **Inspection and assessment** — Some companies offer this free; others charge $75 to $200, which may be credited toward the work
- **Insulation removal and disposal** — Including hauling contaminated material to an appropriate disposal facility
- **Cleaning and sanitization** — HEPA vacuuming of attic surfaces and antimicrobial treatment
- **Air sealing** — Sealing gaps around penetrations before new insulation is installed
- **New insulation** — Material type, target R-value, and coverage area
- **Warranty** — What's covered and for how long, especially on exclusion work and insulation performance

Watch for quotes that seem unusually low. A price that's 40-50% below other estimates often means corners are being cut — typically on sanitization, air sealing, or proper disposal. These are the steps that protect your health and ensure lasting results.

## How to Get Accurate Estimates

Getting a reliable cost estimate requires an in-person inspection. Phone quotes based only on square footage miss critical variables like contamination severity, accessibility challenges, and whether air sealing or structural repairs are needed.

Request quotes from at least three licensed companies. When comparing proposals, focus on scope rather than just price. A $3,000 quote that includes removal, sanitization, air sealing, and R-38 blown-in insulation is a better value than a $2,000 quote that covers only removal and basic re-insulation with no sanitization or air sealing.

Ask each company the following questions:

- What insulation type and R-value are you recommending, and why?
- Does the price include disposal of old insulation?
- What sanitization products do you use, and do you treat the entire attic floor or only visibly contaminated areas?
- Do you perform air sealing before re-insulation?
- What warranty do you offer on the insulation and any exclusion work?
- Are there any rebates or utility incentives you can help me access?

Many utility companies and state programs offer rebates of $200 to $1,000 for insulation upgrades that meet current energy code requirements. A knowledgeable contractor should be aware of these programs and willing to help you apply.

## Bundling Services Saves Money

If your attic needs more than one type of work — rodent cleanup plus insulation replacement, for instance — bundling these services with a single company almost always costs less than hiring separately. The labor overlap is significant: removing insulation once exposes the attic floor for both sanitization and air sealing, which means the crew is already in position for each subsequent step.

Bundled projects also reduce the total time spent in your home and minimize disruption. A comprehensive attic restoration that might take three separate visits from different contractors can often be completed in a single day by one experienced crew.

When evaluating bundled quotes, make sure each component is still itemized so you can compare apples to apples with other estimates. Transparency in pricing is a strong indicator of a reputable company.
