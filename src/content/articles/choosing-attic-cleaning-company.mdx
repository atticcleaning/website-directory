## Check Licensing and Insurance

Before you hire anyone to work in your attic, verify that they carry proper licensing and insurance. At minimum, look for:

- **General liability insurance** that covers property damage during the job
- **Workers' compensation insurance** protecting you if a worker is injured on your property
- **State contractor's license** appropriate for the type of work being performed
- **Pest control certification** if the job involves rodent cleanup or decontamination

A legitimate company will have no problem providing proof of insurance and licensing. If a contractor hesitates or makes excuses, consider it a red flag.

## Ask About Their Process

A quality attic cleaning company should be able to clearly explain their process from start to finish. Key questions to ask include:

1. Do you perform a pre-job inspection?
2. What personal protective equipment does your crew use?
3. How do you contain dust and debris during the job?
4. What disposal methods do you use for contaminated materials?
5. Do you offer insulation replacement after cleanup?

> The best attic cleaning companies treat every job as a health and safety operation, not just a cleanup task. Their process should reflect that level of care.

## Compare Estimates Carefully

Get at least three written estimates before making a decision. Be cautious of quotes that seem unusually low — they often indicate corners will be cut. A thorough estimate should include:

- Detailed scope of work with specific tasks listed
- Material costs broken out separately from labor
- Timeline for completion
- Warranty or guarantee terms
- Cleanup and disposal fees

## Read Reviews and Ask for References

Online reviews can give you a quick sense of a company's reputation, but don't stop there. Ask the company for references from recent jobs similar to yours. A confident contractor will gladly connect you with past customers who can speak to the quality of their work.

Pay attention to how the company responds to negative reviews as well. A professional response that addresses concerns shows accountability and commitment to customer satisfaction.

## Trust Your Instincts

After doing your research, trust your gut feeling. The right company will be responsive to your calls, transparent about pricing, and patient with your questions. They should make you feel informed and confident, not pressured into a quick decision.
